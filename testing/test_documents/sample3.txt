Deep Learning and Neural Networks

Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that uses artificial neural networks with multiple layers (deep architectures) to progressively extract higher-level features from raw input.

Key components of deep learning:
- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs): Specialized for processing grid-like data such as images
- Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs): Designed for sequential data like time series or natural language
- Transformers: Architecture using self-attention mechanisms, revolutionizing NLP
- Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs): Two networks competing to generate realistic data

Deep learning has achieved breakthrough results in computer vision, speech recognition, natural language processing, and game playing. Modern applications include autonomous driving, medical diagnosis, and creative AI systems.
