You\nwill, therefore, permit me to repeat, emphatically, that Marley was as\ndead as a door-nail.\n\nScrooge knew he was dead? Of course he did. How could it be otherwise?\nScrooge and he were partners for I don\'t know how many years. Scrooge\nwas his sole executor, his sole administrator, his sole assign, his sole\nresiduary legatee, his sole friend, and sole mourner. And even Scrooge\nwas not so dreadfully cut up by the sad event but that he was an\nexcellent man of business on the very day of the funeral, and solemnised\nit with an undoubted bargain.\n\nThe mention of Marley\'s funeral brings me back to the point I started\nfrom. There is no doubt that Marley was dead. This must be distinctly\nunderstood, or nothing wonderful can come of the story I am going to\nrelate. If we were not perfectly convinced that Hamlet\'s father died\nbefore the play began, there would be nothing more remarkable in his\ntaking a stroll at night, in an easterly wind, upon his own ramparts,\nthan there would be in any other middle-aged gentleman rashly turning\nout after dark in a breezy spot--say St. Paul\'s Churchyard, for\ninstance--literally to astonish his son\'s weak mind.\n\nScrooge never painted out Old Marley\'s name. There it stood, years\nafterwards, above the warehouse door: Scrooge and Marley. The firm was\nknown as Scrooge and Marley. Sometimes people new to the business called\nScrooge Scrooge, and sometimes Marley, but he answered to both names. It\nwas all the same to him.\n\nOh! but he was a tight-fisted hand at the grindstone, Scrooge! a\nsqueezing, wrenching, grasping, scraping, clutching, covetous old\nsinner! Hard and sharp as flint, from which no steel had ever struck out\ngenerous fire; secret, and self-contained, and solitary as an oyster.\nThe cold within him froze his old features, nipped his pointed nose,\nshrivelled his cheek, stiffened his gait; made his eyes red, his thin\nlips blue; and spoke out shrewdly in his grating voice. A frosty rime\nwas on his head, and on his eyebrows, and his wiry chin. He carried his\nown low temperature always about with him; he iced his office in the\ndog-days, and didn\'t thaw it one degree at Christmas.\n\nExternal heat and cold had little influence on Scrooge. No warmth could\nwarm, no wintry weather chill him. No wind that blew was bitterer than\nhe, no falling snow was more intent upon its purpose, no pelting rain\nless open to entreaty. Foul weather didn\'t know where to have him. The\nheaviest rain, and snow, and hail, and sleet could boast of the\nadvantage over him in only one respect. They often \'came down\'\nhandsomely, and Scrooge never did.\n\nNobody ever stopped him in the street to say, with gladsome looks, \'My\ndear Scrooge, how are you? When will you come to see me?\' No beggars\nimplored him to bestow a trifle, no children asked him what it was\no\'clock, no man or woman ever once in all his life inquired the way to\nsuch and such a place, of Scrooge. Even the blind men\'s dogs appeared to\nknow him; and, when they saw him coming on, would tug their owners into\ndoorways and up courts; and then would wag their tails as though they\nsaid, \'No eye at all is better than an evil eye, dark master!\'\n\nBut what did Scrooge care? It was the very thing he liked. To edge his\nway along the crowded paths of life, warning all human sympathy to keep\nits distance, was what the knowing ones call \'nuts\' to Scrooge.\n\nOnce upon a time--of all the good days in the year, on Christmas\nEve--old Scrooge sat busy in his counting-house. It was cold, bleak,\nbiting weather; foggy withal; and he could hear the people in the court\noutside go wheezing up and down, beating their hands upon their breasts,\nand stamping their feet upon the pavement stones to warm them. The City\nclocks had only just gone three, but it was quite dark already--it had\nnot been light all day--and candles were flaring in the windows of\n```\n'}]

It was cold, bleak,\nbiting weather; foggy withal; and he could hear the people in the court\noutside go wheezing up and down, beating their hands upon their breasts,\nand stamping their feet upon the pavement stones to warm them. The City\nclocks had only just gone three, but it was quite dark already--it had\nnot been light all day--and candles were flaring in the windows of the\nneighbouring offices, like ruddy smears upon the palpable brown air. The\nfog came pouring in at every chink and keyhole, and was so dense\nwithout, that, although the court was of the narrowest, the houses\nopposite were mere phantoms. To see the dingy cloud come drooping down,\nobscuring everything, one might have thought that nature lived hard by,\nand was brewing on a large scale.\n\nThe door of Scrooge\'s counting-house was open, that he might keep his\neye upon his clerk, who in a dismal little cell beyond, a sort of tank,\nwas copying letters. Scrooge had a very small fire, but the clerk\'s fire\nwas so very much smaller that it looked like one coal. But he couldn\'t\nreplenish it, for Scrooge kept the coal-box in his own room; and so\nsurely as the clerk came in with the shovel, the master predicted that\nit would be necessary for them to part. Wherefore the clerk put on his\nwhite comforter, and tried to warm himself at the candle; in which\neffort, not being a man of strong imagination, he failed.\n\n\'A merry Christmas, uncle! God save you!\' cried a cheerful voice. It was\nthe voice of Scrooge\'s nephew, who came upon him so quickly that this\nwas the first intimation he had of his approach.\n\n\'Bah!\' said Scrooge. \'Humbug!\'\n\nHe had so heated himself with rapid walking in the fog and frost, this\nnephew of Scrooge\'s, that he was all in a glow; his face was ruddy and\nhandsome; his eyes sparkled, and his breath smoked again.\n\n\'Christmas a humbug, uncle!\' said Scrooge\'s nephew. \'You don\'t mean\nthat, I am sure?\'\n\n\'I do,\' said Scrooge. \'Merry Christmas! What right have you to be merry?\nWhat reason have you to be merry? You\'re poor enough.\'\n\n\'Come, then,\' returned the nephew gaily. \'What right have you to be\ndismal? What reason have you to be morose? You\'re rich enough.\'\n\nScrooge, having no better answer ready on the spur of the moment, said,\n\'Bah!\' again; and followed it up with \'Humbug!\'\n\n\'Don\'t be cross, uncle!\' said the nephew.\n\n\'What else can I be,\' returned the uncle, \'when I live in such a world\nof fools as this? Merry Christmas! Out upon merry Christmas! What\'s\nChristmas-time to you but a time for paying bills without money; a time\nfor finding yourself a year older, and not an hour richer; a time for\nbalancing your books, and having every item in \'em through a round dozen\nof months presented dead against you? If I could work my will,\' said\nScrooge indignantly, \'every idiot who goes about with "Merry Christmas"\non his lips should be boiled with his own pudding, and buried with a\nstake of holly through his heart. He should!\'\n\n\'Uncle!\' pleaded the nephew.\n\n\'Nephew!\' returned the uncle sternly, \'keep Christmas in your own way,\nand let me keep it in mine.\'\n\n\'Keep it!\' repeated Scrooge\'s nephew. \'But you don\'t keep it.\'\n\n\'Let me leave it alone, then,\' said Scrooge. \'Much good may it do you!\nMuch good it has ever done you!\'\n\n\'There are many things from which I might have derived good, by which I\nhave not profited, I dare say,\' returned the nephew; \'Christmas among\nthe rest.

But I am sure I have always thought of Christmas-time, when\nit has come round--apart from the veneration due to its sacred name and\norigin, if anything belonging to it can be apart from that--as a good\ntime; a kind, forgiving, charitable, pleasant time; the only time I know\nof, in the long calendar of the year, when men and women seem by one\nconsent to open their shut-up hearts freely, and to think of people\nbelow them as if they really were fellow-passengers to the grave, and\nnot another race of creatures bound on other journeys. And therefore,\nuncle, though it has never put a scrap of gold or silver in my pocket, I\nbelieve that it _has_ done me good and _will_ do me good; and I say, God\nbless it!\'\n\nThe clerk in the tank involuntarily applauded. Becoming immediately\nsensible of the impropriety, he poked the fire, and extinguished the\nlast frail spark for ever.\n\n\'Let me hear another sound from _you_,\' said Scrooge, \'and you\'ll keep\nyour Christmas by losing your situation! You\'re quite a powerful\nspeaker, sir,\' he added, turning to his nephew. \'I wonder you don\'t go\ninto Parliament.\'\n\n\'Don\'t be angry, uncle. Come! Dine with us to-morrow.\'\n\nScrooge said that he would see him----Yes, indeed he did. He went the\nwhole length of the expression, and said that he would see him in that\nextremity first.\n\n\'But why?\' cried Scrooge\'s nephew. \'Why?\'\n\n\'Why did you get married?\' said Scrooge.\n\n\'Because I fell in love.\'\n\n\'Because you fell in love!\' growled Scrooge, as if that were the only\none thing in the world more ridiculous than a merry Christmas. \'Good\nafternoon!\'\n\n\'Nay, uncle, but you never came to see me before that happened. Why give\nit as a reason for not coming now?\'\n\n\'Good afternoon,\' said Scrooge.\n\n\'I want nothing from you; I ask nothing of you; why cannot we be\nfriends?\'\n\n\'Good afternoon!\' said Scrooge.\n\n\'I am sorry, with all my heart, to find you so resolute. We have never\nhad any quarrel to which I have been a party. But I have made the trial\nin homage to Christmas, and I\'ll keep my Christmas humour to the last.\nSo A Merry Christmas, uncle!\'\n\n\'Good afternoon,\' said Scrooge.\n\n\'And A Happy New Year!\'\n\n\'Good afternoon!\' said Scrooge.\n\nHis nephew left the room without an angry word, notwithstanding. He\nstopped at the outer door to bestow the greetings of the season on the\nclerk, who, cold as he was, was warmer than Scrooge; for he returned\nthem cordially.\n\n\'There\'s another fellow,\' muttered Scrooge, who overheard him: \'my\nclerk, with fifteen shillings a week, and a wife and family, talking\nabout a merry Christmas. I\'ll retire to Bedlam.\'\n\nThis lunatic, in letting Scrooge\'s nephew out, had let two other people\nin. They were portly gentlemen, pleasant to behold, and now stood, with\ntheir hats off, in Scrooge\'s office. They had books and papers in their\nhands, and bowed to him.\n\n\'Scrooge and Marley\'s, I believe,\' said one of the gentlemen, referring\nto his list. \'Have I the pleasure of addressing Mr. Scrooge, or Mr.\nMarley?\'\n\n\'Mr. Marley has been dead these seven years,\' Scrooge replied. \'He died\nseven years ago, this very night.\'\n\n\'We have no doubt his liberality is well represented by his surviving\npartner,\' said the gentleman, presenting his credentials.\n\n[Illustration: THEY WERE PORTLY GENTLEMEN, PLEASANT TO BEHOLD]\n\nIt certainly was; for they had been two kindred spirits. At the ominous\nword \'liberality\' Scrooge frowned, and shook his head, and handed the\ncredentials back.\n\n\'At this festive season of the year, Mr. Scrooge,\' said the gentleman,\ntaking up a pen, \'it is more than usually desirable that we should make\nsome slight provision for the poor and destitute, who suffer greatly at\nthe present time. Many thousands are in want of common necessaries;\nhundreds of thousands are in want of common comforts, sir.\'\n\n\'Are there no prisons?\' asked Scrooge.\n\n\'Plenty of prisons,\' said the gentleman, laying down the pen again.\n\n\'And the Union workhouses?\' demanded Scrooge. \'Are they still\n```\n'}]

We choose this time, because it is a time, of all\nothers, when Want is keenly felt, and Abundance rejoices. What shall I\nput you down for?\'\n\n\'Nothing!\' Scrooge replied.\n\n\'You wish to be anonymous?\'\n\n\'I wish to be left alone,\' said Scrooge. \'Since you ask me what I wish,\ngentlemen, that is my answer. I don\'t make merry myself at Christmas,\nand I can\'t afford to make idle people merry. I help to support the\nestablishments I have mentioned--they cost enough: and those who are\nbadly off must go there.\'\n\n\'Many can\'t go there; and many would rather die.\'\n\n\'If they would rather die,\' said Scrooge, \'they had better do it, and\ndecrease the surplus population. Besides--excuse me--I don\'t know that.\'\n\n\'But you might know it,\' observed the gentleman.\n\n\'It\'s not my business,\' Scrooge returned. \'It\'s enough for a man to\nunderstand his own business, and not to interfere with other people\'s.\nMine occupies me constantly. Good afternoon, gentlemen!\'\n\nSeeing clearly that it would be useless to pursue their point, the\ngentlemen withdrew. Scrooge resumed his labours with an improved opinion\nof himself, and in a more facetious temper than was usual with him.\n\nMeanwhile the fog and darkness thickened so, that people ran about with\nflaring links, proffering their services to go before horses in\ncarriages, and conduct them on their way. The ancient tower of a church,\nwhose gruff old bell was always peeping slyly down at Scrooge out of a\nGothic window in the wall, became invisible, and struck the hours and\nquarters in the clouds, with tremulous vibrations afterwards, as if its\nteeth were chattering in its frozen head up there. The cold became\nintense. In the main street, at the corner of the court, some labourers\nwere repairing the gas-pipes, and had lighted a great fire in a brazier,\nround which a party of ragged men and boys were gathered: warming their\nhands and winking their eyes before the blaze in rapture. The water-plug\nbeing left in solitude, its overflowings suddenly congealed, and turned\nto misanthropic ice. The brightness of the shops, where holly sprigs and\nberries crackled in the lamp heat of the windows, made pale faces ruddy\nas they passed. Poulterers\' and grocers\' trades became a splendid joke:\na glorious pageant, with which it was next to impossible to believe that\nsuch dull principles as bargain and sale had anything to do. The Lord\nMayor, in the stronghold of the mighty Mansion House, gave orders to his\nfifty cooks and butlers to keep Christmas as a Lord Mayor\'s household\nshould; and even the little tailor, whom he had fined five shillings on\nthe previous Monday for being drunk and bloodthirsty in the streets,\nstirred up to-morrow\'s pudding in his garret, while his lean wife and\nthe baby sallied out to buy the beef.\n\nFoggier yet, and colder!

With an\nill-will Scrooge dismounted from his stool, and tacitly admitted the\nfact to the expectant clerk in the tank, who instantly snuffed his\ncandle out, and put on his hat.\n\n\'You\'ll want all day to-morrow, I suppose?\' said Scrooge.\n\n\'If quite convenient, sir.\'\n\n\'It\'s not convenient,\' said Scrooge, \'and it\'s not fair.

He lived in chambers which had\nonce belonged to his deceased partner. They were a gloomy suite of\nrooms, in a lowering pile of building up a yard, where it had so little\nbusiness to be, that one could scarcely help fancying it must have run\nthere when it was a young house, playing at hide-and-seek with other\nhouses, and have forgotten the way out again. It was old enough now, and\ndreary enough; for nobody lived in it but Scrooge, the other rooms\nbeing all let out as offices. The yard was so dark that even Scrooge,\nwho knew its every stone, was fain to grope with his hands. The fog and\nfrost so hung about the black old gateway of the house, that it seemed\nas if the Genius of the Weather sat in mournful meditation on the\nthreshold.\n\nNow, it is a fact that there was nothing at all particular about the\nknocker on the door, except that it was very large. It is also a fact\nthat Scrooge had seen it, night and morning, during his whole residence\nin that place; also that Scrooge had as little of what is called fancy\nabout him as any man in the City of London, even including--which is a\nbold word--the corporation, aldermen, and livery.

It was cold, bleak,\nbiting weather; foggy withal; and he could hear the people in the court\noutside go wheezing up and down, beating their hands upon their breasts,\nand stamping their feet upon the pavement stones to warm them. The City\nclocks had only just gone three, but it was quite dark already--it had\nnot been light all day--and candles were flaring in the windows of the\nneighbouring offices, like ruddy smears upon the palpable brown air. The\nfog came pouring in at every chink and keyhole, and was so dense\nwithout, that, although the court was of the narrowest, the houses\nopposite were mere phantoms. To see the dingy cloud come drooping down,\nobscuring everything, one might have thought that nature lived hard by,\nand was brewing on a large scale.\n\nThe door of Scrooge\'s counting-house was open, that he might keep his\neye upon his clerk, who in a dismal little cell beyond, a sort of tank,\nwas copying letters. Scrooge had a very small fire, but the clerk\'s fire\nwas so very much smaller that it looked like one coal. But he couldn\'t\nreplenish it, for Scrooge kept the coal-box in his own room; and so\nsurely as the clerk came in with the shovel, the master predicted that\nit would be necessary for them to part. Wherefore the clerk put on his\nwhite comforter, and tried to warm himself at the candle; in which\neffort, not being a man of strong imagination, he failed.\n\n\'A merry Christmas, uncle! God save you!\' cried a cheerful voice. It was\nthe voice of Scrooge\'s nephew, who came upon him so quickly that this\nwas the first intimation he had of his approach.\n\n\'Bah!\' said Scrooge. \'Humbug!\'\n\nHe had so heated himself with rapid walking in the fog and frost, this\nnephew of Scrooge\'s, that he was all in a glow; his face was ruddy and\nhandsome; his eyes sparkled, and his breath smoked again.\n\n\'Christmas a humbug, uncle!\' said Scrooge\'s nephew. \'You don\'t mean\nthat, I am sure?\'\n\n\'I do,\' said Scrooge. \'Merry Christmas! What right have you to be merry?\nWhat reason have you to be merry? You\'re poor enough.\'\n\n\'Come, then,\' returned the nephew gaily. \'What right have you to be\ndismal? What reason have you to be morose? You\'re rich enough.\'\n\nScrooge, having no better answer ready on the spur of the moment, said,\n\'Bah!\' again; and followed it up with \'Humbug!\'\n\n\'Don\'t be cross, uncle!\' said the nephew.\n\n\'What else can I be,\' returned the uncle, \'when I live in such a world\nof fools as this? Merry Christmas! Out upon merry Christmas! What\'s\nChristmas-time to you but a time for paying bills without money; a time\nfor finding yourself a year older, and not an hour richer; a time for\nbalancing your books, and having every item in \'em through a round dozen\nof months presented dead against you? If I could work my will,\' said\nScrooge indignantly, \'every idiot who goes about with "Merry Christmas"\non his lips should be boiled with his own pudding, and buried with a\nstake of holly through his heart. He should!\'\n\n\'Uncle!\' pleaded the nephew.\n\n\'Nephew!\' returned the uncle sternly, \'keep Christmas in your own way,\nand let me keep it in mine.\'\n\n\'Keep it!\' repeated Scrooge\'s nephew. \'But you don\'t keep it.\'\n\n\'Let me leave it alone, then,\' said Scrooge. \'Much good may it do you!\nMuch good it has ever done you!\'\n\n\'There are many things from which I might have derived good, by which I\nhave not profited, I dare say,\' returned the nephew; \'Christmas among\nthe rest. But I am sure I have always thought of Christmas-time, when\nit has come round--apart from the veneration due to its sacred name and\norigin, if anything belonging to it can be apart from that--as a good\ntime; a kind, forgiving, charitable, pleasant time; the only time I know\nof, in the long calendar of the year, when men and women seem by one\nconsent to open their shut-up hearts freely, and to think of people\nbelow them as if they really were fellow-passengers to the grave,\n```\n\n{"named_entities": ["Scrooge", "Christmas Eve", "Christmas", "City", "God", "PlanetRadiocity.com"]}\n'}]

You\nwill, therefore, permit me to repeat, emphatically, that Marley was as\ndead as a door-nail.\n\nScrooge knew he was dead? Of course he did. How could it be otherwise?\nScrooge and he were partners for I don\'t know how many years. Scrooge\nwas his sole executor, his sole administrator, his sole assign, his sole\nresiduary legatee, his sole friend, and sole mourner. And even Scrooge\nwas not so dreadfully cut up by the sad event but that he was an\nexcellent man of business on the very day of the funeral, and solemnised\nit with an undoubted bargain.\n\nThe mention of Marley\'s funeral brings me back to the point I started\nfrom. There is no doubt that Marley was dead. This must be distinctly\nunderstood, or nothing wonderful can come of the story I am going to\nrelate. If we were not perfectly convinced that Hamlet\'s father died\nbefore the play began, there would be nothing more remarkable in his\ntaking a stroll at night, in an easterly wind, upon his own ramparts,\nthan there would be in any other middle-aged gentleman rashly turning\nout after dark in a breezy spot--say St. Paul\'s Churchyard, for\ninstance--literally to astonish his son\'s weak mind.\n\nScrooge never painted out Old Marley\'s name. There it stood, years\nafterwards, above the warehouse door: Scrooge and Marley. The firm was\nknown as Scrooge and Marley. Sometimes people new to the business called\nScrooge Scrooge, and sometimes Marley, but he answered to both names. It\nwas all the same to him.\n\nOh! but he was a tight-fisted hand at the grindstone, Scrooge! a\nsqueezing, wrenching, grasping, scraping, clutching, covetous old\nsinner! Hard and sharp as flint, from which no steel had ever struck out\ngenerous fire; secret, and self-contained, and solitary as an oyster.\nThe cold within him froze his old features, nipped his pointed nose,\nshrivelled his cheek, stiffened his gait; made his eyes red, his thin\nlips blue; and spoke out shrewdly in his grating voice. A frosty rime\nwas on his head, and on his eyebrows, and his wiry chin. He carried his\nown low temperature always about with him; he iced his office in the\ndog-days, and didn\'t thaw it one degree at Christmas.\n\nExternal heat and cold had little influence on Scrooge. No warmth could\nwarm, no wintry weather chill him. No wind that blew was bitterer than\nhe, no falling snow was more intent upon its purpose, no pelting rain\nless open to entreaty. Foul weather didn\'t know where to have him. The\nheaviest rain, and snow, and hail, and sleet could boast of the\nadvantage over him in only one respect. They often \'came down\'\nhandsomely, and Scrooge never did.\n\nNobody ever stopped him in the street to say, with gladsome looks, \'My\ndear Scrooge, how are you? When will you come to see me?\' No beggars\nimplored him to bestow a trifle, no children asked him what it was\no\'clock, no man or woman ever once in all his life inquired the way to\nsuch and such a place, of Scrooge. Even the blind men\'s dogs appeared to\nknow him; and, when they saw him coming on, would tug their owners into\ndoorways and up courts; and then would wag their tails as though they\nsaid, \'No eye at all is better than an evil eye, dark master!\'\n\nBut what did Scrooge care? It was the very thing he liked. To edge his\nway along the crowded paths of life, warning all human sympathy to keep\nits distance, was what the knowing ones call \'nuts\' to Scrooge.\n\nOnce upon a time--of all the good days in the year, on Christmas\nEve--old Scrooge sat busy in his counting-house. It was cold, bleak,\nbiting weather; foggy withal; and he could hear the people in the court\noutside go wheezing up and down, beating their hands upon their breasts,\nand stamping their feet upon the pavement stones to warm them.

I\'ll retire to Bedlam.\'\n\nThis lunatic, in letting Scrooge\'s nephew out, had let two other people\nin. They were portly gentlemen, pleasant to behold, and now stood, with\ntheir hats off, in Scrooge\'s office.

Piercing, searching, biting cold. If the good\nSt. Dunstan had but nipped the Evil Spirit\'s nose with a touch of such\nweather as that, instead of using his familiar weapons, then indeed he\nwould have roared to lusty purpose. The owner of one scant young nose,\ngnawed and mumbled by the hungry cold as bones are gnawed by dogs,\nstooped down at Scrooge\'s keyhole to regale him with a Christmas carol;\nbut, at the first sound of\n\n  \'God bless you, merry gentleman,\n  May nothing you dismay!\'\n\nScrooge seized the ruler with such energy of action that the singer fled\nin terror, leaving the keyhole to the fog, and even more congenial\nfrost.\n\nAt length the hour of shutting up the counting-house arrived. With an\nill-will Scrooge dismounted from his stool, and tacitly admitted the\nfact to the expectant clerk in the tank, who instantly snuffed his\ncandle out, and put on his hat.\n\n\'You\'ll want all day to-morrow, I suppose?\' said Scrooge.\n\n\'If quite convenient, sir.\'\n\n\'It\'s not convenient,\' said Scrooge, \'and it\'s not fair. If I was to\nstop half-a-crown for it, you\'d think yourself ill used, I\'ll be bound?\'\n\nThe clerk smiled faintly.\n\n\'And yet,\' said Scrooge, \'you don\'t think _me_ ill used when I pay a\nday\'s wages for no work.\'\n\n[Illustration: _Bob Cratchit went down a slide on Cornhill, at the end\nof a lane of boys, twenty times, in honour of its being Christmas\nEve_]\n\nThe clerk observed that it was only once a year.\n\n\'A poor excuse for picking a man\'s pocket every twenty-fifth of\nDecember!\' said Scrooge, buttoning his greatcoat to the chin. \'But I\nsuppose you must have the whole day. Be here all the earlier next\nmorning.\'\n\nThe clerk promised that he would; and Scrooge walked out with a growl.\nThe office was closed in a twinkling, and the clerk, with the long ends\nof his white comforter dangling below his waist (for he boasted no\ngreatcoat), went down a slide on Cornhill, at the end of a lane of boys,\ntwenty times, in honour of its being Christmas Eve, and then ran home to\nCamden Town as hard as he could pelt, to play at blind man\'s-buff.\n\nScrooge took his melancholy dinner in his usual melancholy tavern; and\nhaving read all the newspapers, and beguiled the rest of the evening\nwith his banker\'s book, went home to bed. He lived in chambers which had\nonce belonged to his deceased partner. They were a gloomy suite of\nrooms, in a lowering pile of building up a yard, where it had so little\nbusiness to be, that one could scarcely help fancying it must have run\nthere when it was a young house, playing at hide-and-seek with other\nhouses, and have forgotten the way out again. It was old enough now, and\ndreary enough; for nobody lived in it but Scrooge, the other rooms\nbeing all let out as offices. The yard was so dark that even Scrooge,\nwho knew its every stone, was fain to grope with his hands. The fog and\nfrost so hung about the black old gateway of the house, that it seemed\nas if the Genius of the Weather sat in mournful meditation on the\nthreshold.\n\nNow, it is a fact that there was nothing at all particular about the\nknocker on the door, except that it was very large. It is also a fact\nthat Scrooge had seen it, night and morning, during his whole residence\nin that place; also that Scrooge had as little of what is called fancy\nabout him as any man in the City of London, even including--which is a\nbold word--the corporation, aldermen, and livery. Let it also be borne\nin mind that Scrooge had not bestowed one thought on Marley since his\nlast mention of his seven-years\'-dead partner that afternoon. And then\nlet any man explain to me, if he can, how it happened that Scrooge,\nhaving his key in the lock of the door, saw in the knocker, without its\nundergoing any intermediate process of change--not a knocker, but\nMarley\'s face\n```\n\n{"named_entities": ["Scrooge", "St. Dunstan", "Evil Spirit", "Christmas", "Bob Cratchit", "Cornhill", "Camden Town", "London", "Marley"]}\n'}]

Many thousands are in want of common necessaries;\nhundreds of thousands are in want of common comforts, sir.\'\n\n\'Are there no prisons?\' asked Scrooge.\n\n\'Plenty of prisons,\' said the gentleman, laying down the pen again.\n\n\'And the Union workhouses?\' demanded Scrooge. \'Are they still in\noperation?\'\n\n\'They are. Still,\' returned the gentleman, \'I wish I could say they were\nnot.\'\n\n\'The Treadmill and the Poor Law are in full vigour, then?\' said Scrooge.\n\n\'Both very busy, sir.\'\n\n\'Oh! I was afraid, from what you said at first, that something had\noccurred to stop them in their useful course,\' said Scrooge. \'I am very\nglad to hear it.\'\n\n\'Under the impression that they scarcely furnish Christian cheer of mind\nor body to the multitude,\' returned the gentleman, \'a few of us are\nendeavouring to raise a fund to buy the Poor some meat and drink, and\nmeans of warmth. We choose this time, because it is a time, of all\nothers, when Want is keenly felt, and Abundance rejoices. What shall I\nput you down for?\'\n\n\'Nothing!\' Scrooge replied.\n\n\'You wish to be anonymous?\'\n\n\'I wish to be left alone,\' said Scrooge. \'Since you ask me what I wish,\ngentlemen, that is my answer. I don\'t make merry myself at Christmas,\nand I can\'t afford to make idle people merry. I help to support the\nestablishments I have mentioned--they cost enough: and those who are\nbadly off must go there.\'\n\n\'Many can\'t go there; and many would rather die.\'\n\n\'If they would rather die,\' said Scrooge, \'they had better do it, and\ndecrease the surplus population. Besides--excuse me--I don\'t know that.\'\n\n\'But you might know it,\' observed the gentleman.\n\n\'It\'s not my business,\' Scrooge returned. \'It\'s enough for a man to\nunderstand his own business, and not to interfere with other people\'s.\nMine occupies me constantly. Good afternoon, gentlemen!\'\n\nSeeing clearly that it would be useless to pursue their point, the\ngentlemen withdrew. Scrooge resumed his labours with an improved opinion\nof himself, and in a more facetious temper than was usual with him.\n\nMeanwhile the fog and darkness thickened so, that people ran about with\nflaring links, proffering their services to go before horses in\ncarriages, and conduct them on their way. The ancient tower of a church,\nwhose gruff old bell was always peeping slyly down at Scrooge out of a\nGothic window in the wall, became invisible, and struck the hours and\nquarters in the clouds, with tremulous vibrations afterwards, as if its\nteeth were chattering in its frozen head up there. The cold became\nintense. In the main street, at the corner of the court, some labourers\nwere repairing the gas-pipes, and had lighted a great fire in a brazier,\nround which a party of ragged men and boys were gathered: warming their\nhands and winking their eyes before the blaze in rapture. The water-plug\nbeing left in solitude, its overflowings suddenly congealed, and turned\nto misanthropic ice. The brightness of the shops, where holly sprigs and\nberries crackled in the lamp heat of the windows, made pale faces ruddy\nas they passed. Poulterers\' and grocers\' trades became a splendid joke:\na glorious pageant, with which it was next to impossible to believe that\nsuch dull principles as bargain and sale had anything to do. The Lord\nMayor, in the stronghold of the mighty Mansion House, gave orders to his\nfifty cooks and butlers to keep Christmas as a Lord Mayor\'s household\nshould; and even the little tailor, whom he had fined five shillings on\nthe previous Monday for being drunk and bloodthirsty in the streets,\nstirred up to-morrow\'s pudding in his garret, while his lean wife and\nthe baby sallied out to buy the beef.\n\nFoggier yet, and colder! Piercing, searching, biting cold. If the good\nSt. Dunstan had but nipped the Evil Spirit\'s nose with a touch of such\nweather as that, instead of using his familiar weapons, then indeed he\nwould have roared to lusty purpose. The owner of one scant young nose,\ngnawed and\n```\n\n{"named_entities": ["Scrooge", "Christmas", "Lord Mayor", "St. Dunstan"]}\n'}]

You\nwill, therefore, permit me to repeat, emphatically, that Marley was as\ndead as a door-nail.\n\nScrooge knew he was dead? Of course he did. How could it be otherwise?\nScrooge and he were partners for I don\'t know how many years. Scrooge\nwas his sole executor, his sole administrator, his sole assign, his sole\nresiduary legatee, his sole friend, and sole mourner. And even Scrooge\nwas not so dreadfully cut up by the sad event but that he was an\nexcellent man of business on the very day of the funeral, and solemnised\nit with an undoubted bargain.\n\nThe mention of Marley\'s funeral brings me back to the point I started\nfrom. There is no doubt that Marley was dead. This must be distinctly\nunderstood, or nothing wonderful can come of the story I am going to\nrelate. If we were not perfectly convinced that Hamlet\'s father died\nbefore the play began, there would be nothing more remarkable in his\ntaking a stroll at night, in an easterly wind, upon his own ramparts,\nthan there would be in any other middle-aged gentleman rashly turning\nout after dark in a breezy spot--say St. Paul\'s Churchyard, for\ninstance--literally to astonish his son\'s weak mind.\n\nScrooge never painted out Old Marley\'s name. There it stood, years\nafterwards, above the warehouse door: Scrooge and Marley. The firm was\nknown as Scrooge and Marley. Sometimes people new to the business called\nScrooge Scrooge, and sometimes Marley, but he answered to both names. It\nwas all the same to him.\n\nOh! but he was a tight-fisted hand at the grindstone, Scrooge! a\nsqueezing, wrenching, grasping, scraping, clutching, covetous old\nsinner! Hard and sharp as flint, from which no steel had ever struck out\ngenerous fire; secret, and self-contained, and solitary as an oyster.\nThe cold within him froze his old features, nipped his pointed nose,\nshrivelled his cheek, stiffened his gait; made his eyes red, his thin\nlips blue; and spoke out shrewdly in his grating voice. A frosty rime\nwas on his head, and on his eyebrows, and his wiry chin. He carried his\nown low temperature always about with him; he iced his office in the\ndog-days, and didn\'t thaw it one degree at Christmas.\n\nExternal heat and cold had little influence on Scrooge. No warmth could\nwarm, no wintry weather chill him. No wind that blew was bitterer than\nhe, no falling snow was more intent upon its purpose, no pelting rain\nless open to entreaty. Foul weather didn\'t know where to have him. The\nheaviest rain, and snow, and hail, and sleet could boast of the\nadvantage over him in only one respect. They often \'came down\'\nhandsomely, and Scrooge never did.\n\nNobody ever stopped him in the street to say, with gladsome looks, \'My\ndear Scrooge, how are you? When will you come to see me?\' No beggars\nimplored him to bestow a trifle, no children asked him what it was\no\'clock, no man or woman ever once in all his life inquired the way to\nsuch and such a place, of Scrooge. Even the blind men\'s dogs appeared to\nknow him; and, when they saw him coming on, would tug their owners into\ndoorways and up courts; and then would wag their tails as though they\nsaid, \'No eye at all is better than an evil eye, dark master!\'\n\nBut what did Scrooge care? It was the very thing he liked. To edge his\nway along the crowded paths of life, warning all human sympathy to keep\nits distance, was what the knowing ones call \'nuts\' to Scrooge.\n\nOnce upon a time--of all the good days in the year, on Christmas\nEve--old Scrooge sat busy in his counting-house. It was cold, bleak,\nbiting weather; foggy withal; and he could hear the people in the court\noutside go wheezing up and down, beating their hands upon their breasts,\nand stamping their feet upon the pavement stones to warm them.

It was cold, bleak,\nbiting weather; foggy withal; and he could hear the people in the court\noutside go wheezing up and down, beating their hands upon their breasts,\nand stamping their feet upon the pavement stones to warm them. The City\nclocks had only just gone three, but it was quite dark already--it had\nnot been light all day--and candles were flaring in the windows of the\nneighbouring offices, like ruddy smears upon the palpable brown air. The\nfog came pouring in at every chink and keyhole, and was so dense\nwithout, that, although the court was of the narrowest, the houses\nopposite were mere phantoms. To see the dingy cloud come drooping down,\nobscuring everything, one might have thought that nature lived hard by,\nand was brewing on a large scale.\n\nThe door of Scrooge\'s counting-house was open, that he might keep his\neye upon his clerk, who in a dismal little cell beyond, a sort of tank,\nwas copying letters. Scrooge had a very small fire, but the clerk\'s fire\nwas so very much smaller that it looked like one coal. But he couldn\'t\nreplenish it, for Scrooge kept the coal-box in his own room; and so\nsurely as the clerk came in with the shovel, the master predicted that\nit would be necessary for them to part. Wherefore the clerk put on his\nwhite comforter, and tried to warm himself at the candle; in which\neffort, not being a man of strong imagination, he failed.\n\n\'A merry Christmas, uncle!

It was\nthe voice of Scrooge\'s nephew, who came upon him so quickly that this\nwas the first intimation he had of his approach.\n\n\'Bah!\' said Scrooge. \'Humbug!\'\n\nHe had so heated himself with rapid walking in the fog and frost, this\nnephew of Scrooge\'s, that he was all in a glow; his face was ruddy and\nhandsome; his eyes sparkled, and his breath smoked again.\n\n\'Christmas a humbug, uncle!\' said Scrooge\'s nephew. \'You don\'t mean\nthat, I am sure?\'\n\n\'I do,\' said Scrooge. \'Merry Christmas! What right have you to be merry?\nWhat reason have you to be merry? You\'re poor enough.\'\n\n\'Come, then,\' returned the nephew gaily. \'What right have you to be\ndismal? What reason have you to be morose? You\'re rich enough.\'\n\nScrooge, having no better answer ready on the spur of the moment, said,\n\'Bah!\' again; and followed it up with \'Humbug!\'\n\n\'Don\'t be cross, uncle!\' said the nephew.\n\n\'What else can I be,\' returned the uncle, \'when I live in such a world\nof fools as this? Merry Christmas! Out upon merry Christmas! What\'s\nChristmas-time to you but a time for paying bills without money; a time\nfor finding yourself a year older, and not an hour richer; a time for\nbalancing your books, and having every item in \'em through a round dozen\nof months presented dead against you? If I could work my will,\' said\nScrooge indignantly, \'every idiot who goes about with "Merry Christmas"\non his lips should be boiled with his own pudding, and buried with a\nstake of holly through his heart. He should!\'\n\n\'Uncle!\' pleaded the nephew.\n\n\'Nephew!\' returned the uncle sternly, \'keep Christmas in your own way,\nand let me keep it in mine.\'\n\n\'Keep it!\' repeated Scrooge\'s nephew. \'But you don\'t keep it.\'\n\n\'Let me leave it alone, then,\' said Scrooge. \'Much good may it do you!\nMuch good it has ever done you!\'\n\n\'There are many things from which I might have derived good, by which I\nhave not profited, I dare say,\' returned the nephew; \'Christmas among\nthe rest. But I am sure I have always thought of Christmas-time, when\nit has come round--apart from the veneration due to its sacred name and\norigin, if anything belonging to it can be apart from that--as a good\ntime; a kind, forgiving, charitable, pleasant time; the only time I know\nof, in the long calendar of the year, when men and women seem by one\nconsent to open their shut-up hearts freely, and to think of people\nbelow them as if they really were fellow-passengers to the grave,\n######################\nOutput:\n'}]

Piercing, searching, biting cold. If the good\nSt. Dunstan had but nipped the Evil Spirit\'s nose with a touch of such\nweather as that, instead of using his familiar weapons, then indeed he\nwould have roared to lusty purpose. The owner of one scant young nose,\ngnawed and mumbled by the hungry cold as bones are gnawed by dogs,\nstooped down at Scrooge\'s keyhole to regale him with a Christmas carol;\nbut, at the first sound of\n\n  \'God bless you, merry gentleman,\n  May nothing you dismay!\'\n\nScrooge seized the ruler with such energy of action that the singer fled\nin terror, leaving the keyhole to the fog, and even more congenial\nfrost.\n\nAt length the hour of shutting up the counting-house arrived. With an\nill-will Scrooge dismounted from his stool, and tacitly admitted the\nfact to the expectant clerk in the tank, who instantly snuffed his\ncandle out, and put on his hat.\n\n\'You\'ll want all day to-morrow, I suppose?\' said Scrooge.\n\n\'If quite convenient, sir.\'\n\n\'It\'s not convenient,\' said Scrooge, \'and it\'s not fair.

He lived in chambers which had\nonce belonged to his deceased partner. They were a gloomy suite of\nrooms, in a lowering pile of building up a yard, where it had so little\nbusiness to be, that one could scarcely help fancying it must have run\nthere when it was a young house, playing at hide-and-seek with other\nhouses, and have forgotten the way out again. It was old enough now, and\ndreary enough; for nobody lived in it but Scrooge, the other rooms\nbeing all let out as offices. The yard was so dark that even Scrooge,\nwho knew its every stone, was fain to grope with his hands.

It was not in impenetrable shadow, as the other objects\nin the yard were, but had a dismal light about it, like a bad lobster in\na dark cellar. It was not angry or ferocious, but looked at Scrooge as\nMarley used to look; with ghostly spectacles turned up on its ghostly\nforehead. The hair was curiously stirred, as if by breath or hot air;\nand, though the eyes were wide open, they were perfectly motionless.\nThat, and its livid colour, made it horrible; but its horror seemed to\nbe in spite of the face, and beyond its control, rather than a part of\nits own expression.\n\nAs Scrooge looked fixedly at this phenomenon, it was a knocker again.\n\nTo say that he was not startled, or that his blood was not conscious of\na terrible sensation to which it had been a stranger from infancy, would\nbe untrue. But he put his hand upon the key he had relinquished, turned\nit sturdily, walked in, and lighted his candle.\n\nHe _did_ pause, with a moment\'s irresolution, before he shut the door;\nand he _did_ look cautiously behind it first, as if he half expected to\nbe terrified with the sight of Marley\'s pigtail sticking out into the\nhall. But there was nothing on the back of the door, except the screws\nand nuts that held the knocker on, so he said, \'Pooh, pooh!\' and closed\nit with a bang.\n\nThe sound resounded through the house like thunder. Every room above,\nand every cask in the wine-merchant\'s cellars below, appeared to have a\nseparate peal of echoes of its own. Scrooge was not a man to be\nfrightened by echoes. He fastened the door, and walked across the hall,\nand up the stairs: slowly, too: trimming his candle as he went.\n\nYou may talk vaguely about driving a coach and six up a good old flight\nof stairs, or through a bad young Act of Parliament; but I mean to say\nyou might have got a hearse up that staircase, and taken it broadwise,\nwith the splinter-bar towards the wall, and the door towards the\nbalustrades: and done it easy. There was plenty of width for that, and\nroom to spare; which is perhaps the reason why Scrooge thought he saw a\nlocomotive hearse going on before him in the gloom. Half-a-dozen\ngas-lamps out of the street wouldn\'t have lighted the entry too well, so\nyou may suppose that it was pretty dark with Scrooge\'s dip.\n\nUp Scrooge went, not caring a button for that. Darkness is cheap, and\nScrooge liked it. But, before he shut his heavy door, he walked through\nhis rooms to see that all was right. He had just enough recollection of\nthe face to desire to do that.\n\nSitting-room, bedroom, lumber-room. All as they should be. Nobody under\nthe table, nobody under the sofa; a small fire in the grate; spoon and\nbasin ready; and the little saucepan of gruel (Scrooge had a cold in his\nhead) upon the hob. Nobody under the bed; nobody in the closet; nobody\nin his dressing-gown, which was hanging up in a suspicious attitude\nagainst the wall. Lumber-room as usual. Old fire-guard, old shoes, two\nfish baskets, washing-stand on three legs, and a poker.\n\n[Illustration: _Nobody under the bed; nobody in the closet; nobody in\nhis dressing-gown, which was hanging up in a suspicious attitude against\nthe wall_]\n\nQuite satisfied, he closed his door, and locked himself in; double\nlocked himself in, which was not his custom. Thus secured against\nsurprise, he took off his cravat; put on his dressing-gown and slippers,\nand his nightcap; and sat down before the fire to take his gruel.\n\nIt was a very low fire indeed; nothing on such a bitter night. He was\nobliged to sit close to it, and brood\n######################\nOutput:\n'}]

It was cold, bleak,\nbiting weather; foggy withal; and he could hear the people in the court\noutside go wheezing up and down, beating their hands upon their breasts,\nand stamping their feet upon the pavement stones to warm them. The City\nclocks had only just gone three, but it was quite dark already--it had\nnot been light all day--and candles were flaring in the windows of the\nneighbouring offices, like ruddy smears upon the palpable brown air. The\nfog came pouring in at every chink and keyhole, and was so dense\nwithout, that, although the court was of the narrowest, the houses\nopposite were mere phantoms. To see the dingy cloud come drooping down,\nobscuring everything, one might have thought that nature lived hard by,\nand was brewing on a large scale.\n\nThe door of Scrooge\'s counting-house was open, that he might keep his\neye upon his clerk, who in a dismal little cell beyond, a sort of tank,\nwas copying letters. Scrooge had a very small fire, but the clerk\'s fire\nwas so very much smaller that it looked like one coal. But he couldn\'t\nreplenish it, for Scrooge kept the coal-box in his own room; and so\nsurely as the clerk came in with the shovel, the master predicted that\nit would be necessary for them to part. Wherefore the clerk put on his\nwhite comforter, and tried to warm himself at the candle; in which\neffort, not being a man of strong imagination, he failed.\n\n\'A merry Christmas, uncle! God save you!\' cried a cheerful voice. It was\nthe voice of Scrooge\'s nephew, who came upon him so quickly that this\nwas the first intimation he had of his approach.\n\n\'Bah!\' said Scrooge. \'Humbug!\'\n\nHe had so heated himself with rapid walking in the fog and frost, this\nnephew of Scrooge\'s, that he was all in a glow; his face was ruddy and\nhandsome; his eyes sparkled, and his breath smoked again.\n\n\'Christmas a humbug, uncle!\' said Scrooge\'s nephew. \'You don\'t mean\nthat, I am sure?\'\n\n\'I do,\' said Scrooge. \'Merry Christmas! What right have you to be merry?\nWhat reason have you to be merry? You\'re poor enough.\'\n\n\'Come, then,\' returned the nephew gaily. \'What right have you to be\ndismal? What reason have you to be morose? You\'re rich enough.\'\n\nScrooge, having no better answer ready on the spur of the moment, said,\n\'Bah!\' again; and followed it up with \'Humbug!\'\n\n\'Don\'t be cross, uncle!\' said the nephew.\n\n\'What else can I be,\' returned the uncle, \'when I live in such a world\nof fools as this? Merry Christmas! Out upon merry Christmas! What\'s\nChristmas-time to you but a time for paying bills without money; a time\nfor finding yourself a year older, and not an hour richer; a time for\nbalancing your books, and having every item in \'em through a round dozen\nof months presented dead against you? If I could work my will,\' said\nScrooge indignantly, \'every idiot who goes about with "Merry Christmas"\non his lips should be boiled with his own pudding, and buried with a\nstake of holly through his heart. He should!\'\n\n\'Uncle!\' pleaded the nephew.\n\n\'Nephew!\' returned the uncle sternly, \'keep Christmas in your own way,\nand let me keep it in mine.\'\n\n\'Keep it!\' repeated Scrooge\'s nephew. \'But you don\'t keep it.\'\n\n\'Let me leave it alone, then,\' said Scrooge. \'Much good may it do you!\nMuch good it has ever done you!\'\n\n\'There are many things from which I might have derived good, by which I\nhave not profited, I dare say,\' returned the nephew; \'Christmas among\nthe rest. But I am sure I have always thought of Christmas-time, when\nit has come round--apart from the veneration due to its sacred name and\norigin, if anything belonging to it can be apart from that--as a good\ntime; a kind, forgiving, charitable, pleasant time; the only time I know\nof, in the long calendar of the year, when men and women seem by one\nconsent to open their shut-up hearts freely, and to think of people\nbelow them as if they really were fellow-passengers to the grave,\n######################\nOutput:\n\n: ("entity"<|>"Scrooge"<|>"person"<|>"Scrooge is a character described as wealthy, miserly, and cynical towards Christmas and its traditions.")##\n("entity"<|>"Scrooge\'s Nephew"<|>"person"<|>"Scrooge\'s Nephew is portrayed as cheerful, optimistic, and challenging Scrooge\'s views on Christmas.")##\n("entity"<|>"Christmas"<|>"event"<|>"Christmas is depicted as a time of celebration, generosity, and reflection on values and traditions.")##\n("relationship"<|>"Scrooge"<|>"Scrooge\'s Nephew"<|>"Scrooge and his nephew have contrasting views on Christmas, leading to heated exchanges."<|>"opposing perspectives, family dynamics"<|>8)##\n("content_keywords"<|>"wealth, Christmas traditions, family dynamics, generosity")<|COMPLETE|>\n: MANY entities were missed in the last extraction.

You\nwill, therefore, permit me to repeat, emphatically, that Marley was as\ndead as a door-nail.\n\nScrooge knew he was dead? Of course he did. How could it be otherwise?\nScrooge and he were partners for I don\'t know how many years. Scrooge\nwas his sole executor, his sole administrator, his sole assign, his sole\nresiduary legatee, his sole friend, and sole mourner. And even Scrooge\nwas not so dreadfully cut up by the sad event but that he was an\nexcellent man of business on the very day of the funeral, and solemnised\nit with an undoubted bargain.\n\nThe mention of Marley\'s funeral brings me back to the point I started\nfrom. There is no doubt that Marley was dead. This must be distinctly\nunderstood, or nothing wonderful can come of the story I am going to\nrelate. If we were not perfectly convinced that Hamlet\'s father died\nbefore the play began, there would be nothing more remarkable in his\ntaking a stroll at night, in an easterly wind, upon his own ramparts,\nthan there would be in any other middle-aged gentleman rashly turning\nout after dark in a breezy spot--say St. Paul\'s Churchyard, for\ninstance--literally to astonish his son\'s weak mind.\n\nScrooge never painted out Old Marley\'s name. There it stood, years\nafterwards, above the warehouse door: Scrooge and Marley. The firm was\nknown as Scrooge and Marley. Sometimes people new to the business called\nScrooge Scrooge, and sometimes Marley, but he answered to both names. It\nwas all the same to him.\n\nOh! but he was a tight-fisted hand at the grindstone, Scrooge! a\nsqueezing, wrenching, grasping, scraping, clutching, covetous old\nsinner! Hard and sharp as flint, from which no steel had ever struck out\ngenerous fire; secret, and self-contained, and solitary as an oyster.\nThe cold within him froze his old features, nipped his pointed nose,\nshrivelled his cheek, stiffened his gait; made his eyes red, his thin\nlips blue; and spoke out shrewdly in his grating voice. A frosty rime\nwas on his head, and on his eyebrows, and his wiry chin. He carried his\nown low temperature always about with him; he iced his office in the\ndog-days, and didn\'t thaw it one degree at Christmas.\n\nExternal heat and cold had little influence on Scrooge. No warmth could\nwarm, no wintry weather chill him. No wind that blew was bitterer than\nhe, no falling snow was more intent upon its purpose, no pelting rain\nless open to entreaty. Foul weather didn\'t know where to have him. The\nheaviest rain, and snow, and hail, and sleet could boast of the\nadvantage over him in only one respect. They often \'came down\'\nhandsomely, and Scrooge never did.\n\nNobody ever stopped him in the street to say, with gladsome looks, \'My\ndear Scrooge, how are you? When will you come to see me?\' No beggars\nimplored him to bestow a trifle, no children asked him what it was\no\'clock, no man or woman ever once in all his life inquired the way to\nsuch and such a place, of Scrooge. Even the blind men\'s dogs appeared to\nknow him; and, when they saw him coming on, would tug their owners into\ndoorways and up courts; and then would wag their tails as though they\nsaid, \'No eye at all is better than an evil eye, dark master!\'\n\nBut what did Scrooge care? It was the very thing he liked. To edge his\nway along the crowded paths of life, warning all human sympathy to keep\nits distance, was what the knowing ones call \'nuts\' to Scrooge.\n\nOnce upon a time--of all the good days in the year, on Christmas\nEve--old Scrooge sat busy in his counting-house. It was cold, bleak,\nbiting weather; foggy withal; and he could hear the people in the court\noutside go wheezing up and down, beating their hands upon their breasts,\nand stamping their feet upon the pavement stones to warm them. The City\nclocks had only just gone three, but it was quite dark already--it had\nnot been light all day--and candles were flaring in the windows of\n######################\nOutput:\n\n: ("entity"<|>"Marley"<|>"person"<|>"Marley is described as dead, with a significant connection to Scrooge in business and as a friend.")##\n("entity"<|>"Scrooge"<|>"person"<|>"Scrooge is portrayed as a tight-fisted, cold-hearted individual with a solitary and self-contained demeanor.")##\n("entity"<|>"Hamlet\'s Father"<|>"person"<|>"Hamlet\'s Father is mentioned in comparison to Marley, emphasizing the certainty of his death before the play began.")##\n("entity"<|>"Scrooge and Marley"<|>"organization"<|>"Scrooge and Marley is a firm known for its association with both Scrooge and Marley, with the name still visible above the warehouse door.")##\n("relationship"<|>"Marley"<|>"Scrooge"<|>"Marley and Scrooge had a close business partnership and personal connection, with Scrooge being deeply affected by Marley\'s death."<|>"business partners, personal connection"<|>8)##\n("relationship"<|>"Scrooge"<|>"Scrooge and Marley"<|>"Scrooge is associated with the firm Scrooge and Marley, responding to both names and maintaining the legacy of the partnership."<|>"business identity, legacy"<|>7)##\n("content_keywords"<|>"death, partnership, business identity, cold-heartedness")<|COMPLETE|>\n: MANY entities were missed in the last extraction.

Many thousands are in want of common necessaries;\nhundreds of thousands are in want of common comforts, sir.\'\n\n\'Are there no prisons?\' asked Scrooge.\n\n\'Plenty of prisons,\' said the gentleman, laying down the pen again.\n\n\'And the Union workhouses?\' demanded Scrooge. \'Are they still in\noperation?\'\n\n\'They are. Still,\' returned the gentleman, \'I wish I could say they were\nnot.\'\n\n\'The Treadmill and the Poor Law are in full vigour, then?\' said Scrooge.\n\n\'Both very busy, sir.\'\n\n\'Oh! I was afraid, from what you said at first, that something had\noccurred to stop them in their useful course,\' said Scrooge. \'I am very\nglad to hear it.\'\n\n\'Under the impression that they scarcely furnish Christian cheer of mind\nor body to the multitude,\' returned the gentleman, \'a few of us are\nendeavouring to raise a fund to buy the Poor some meat and drink, and\nmeans of warmth. We choose this time, because it is a time, of all\nothers, when Want is keenly felt, and Abundance rejoices. What shall I\nput you down for?\'\n\n\'Nothing!\' Scrooge replied.\n\n\'You wish to be anonymous?\'\n\n\'I wish to be left alone,\' said Scrooge. \'Since you ask me what I wish,\ngentlemen, that is my answer. I don\'t make merry myself at Christmas,\nand I can\'t afford to make idle people merry. I help to support the\nestablishments I have mentioned--they cost enough: and those who are\nbadly off must go there.\'\n\n\'Many can\'t go there; and many would rather die.\'\n\n\'If they would rather die,\' said Scrooge, \'they had better do it, and\ndecrease the surplus population. Besides--excuse me--I don\'t know that.\'\n\n\'But you might know it,\' observed the gentleman.\n\n\'It\'s not my business,\' Scrooge returned. \'It\'s enough for a man to\nunderstand his own business, and not to interfere with other people\'s.\nMine occupies me constantly. Good afternoon, gentlemen!\'\n\nSeeing clearly that it would be useless to pursue their point, the\ngentlemen withdrew. Scrooge resumed his labours with an improved opinion\nof himself, and in a more facetious temper than was usual with him.\n\nMeanwhile the fog and darkness thickened so, that people ran about with\nflaring links, proffering their services to go before horses in\ncarriages, and conduct them on their way. The ancient tower of a church,\nwhose gruff old bell was always peeping slyly down at Scrooge out of a\nGothic window in the wall, became invisible, and struck the hours and\nquarters in the clouds, with tremulous vibrations afterwards, as if its\nteeth were chattering in its frozen head up there. The cold became\nintense. In the main street, at the corner of the court, some labourers\nwere repairing the gas-pipes, and had lighted a great fire in a brazier,\nround which a party of ragged men and boys were gathered: warming their\nhands and winking their eyes before the blaze in rapture. The water-plug\nbeing left in solitude, its overflowings suddenly congealed, and turned\nto misanthropic ice. The brightness of the shops, where holly sprigs and\nberries crackled in the lamp heat of the windows, made pale faces ruddy\nas they passed. Poulterers\' and grocers\' trades became a splendid joke:\na glorious pageant, with which it was next to impossible to believe that\nsuch dull principles as bargain and sale had anything to do. The Lord\nMayor, in the stronghold of the mighty Mansion House, gave orders to his\nfifty cooks and butlers to keep Christmas as a Lord Mayor\'s household\nshould; and even the little tailor, whom he had fined five shillings on\nthe previous Monday for being drunk and bloodthirsty in the streets,\nstirred up to-morrow\'s pudding in his garret, while his lean wife and\nthe baby sallied out to buy the beef.\n\nFoggier yet, and colder! Piercing, searching, biting cold. If the good\nSt. Dunstan had but nipped the Evil Spirit\'s nose with a touch of such\nweather as that, instead of using his familiar weapons, then indeed he\nwould have roared to lusty purpose.

Let it also be borne\nin mind that Scrooge had not bestowed one thought on Marley since his\nlast mention of his seven-years\'-dead partner that afternoon. And then\nlet any man explain to me, if he can, how it happened that Scrooge,\nhaving his key in the lock of the door, saw in the knocker, without its\nundergoing any intermediate process of change--not a knocker, but\nMarley\'s face.\n\nMarley\'s face. It was not in impenetrable shadow, as the other objects\nin the yard were, but had a dismal light about it, like a bad lobster in\na dark cellar. It was not angry or ferocious, but looked at Scrooge as\nMarley used to look; with ghostly spectacles turned up on its ghostly\nforehead. The hair was curiously stirred, as if by breath or hot air;\nand, though the eyes were wide open, they were perfectly motionless.\nThat, and its livid colour, made it horrible; but its horror seemed to\nbe in spite of the face, and beyond its control, rather than a part of\nits own expression.\n\nAs Scrooge looked fixedly at this phenomenon, it was a knocker again.\n\nTo say that he was not startled, or that his blood was not conscious of\na terrible sensation to which it had been a stranger from infancy, would\nbe untrue. But he put his hand upon the key he had relinquished, turned\nit sturdily, walked in, and lighted his candle.\n\nHe _did_ pause, with a moment\'s irresolution, before he shut the door;\nand he _did_ look cautiously behind it first, as if he half expected to\nbe terrified with the sight of Marley\'s pigtail sticking out into the\nhall. But there was nothing on the back of the door, except the screws\nand nuts that held the knocker on, so he said, \'Pooh, pooh!\' and closed\nit with a bang.\n\nThe sound resounded through the house like thunder. Every room above,\nand every cask in the wine-merchant\'s cellars below, appeared to have a\nseparate peal of echoes of its own. Scrooge was not a man to be\nfrightened by echoes. He fastened the door, and walked across the hall,\nand up the stairs: slowly, too: trimming his candle as he went.\n\nYou may talk vaguely about driving a coach and six up a good old flight\nof stairs, or through a bad young Act of Parliament; but I mean to say\nyou might have got a hearse up that staircase, and taken it broadwise,\nwith the splinter-bar towards the wall, and the door towards the\nbalustrades: and done it easy. There was plenty of width for that, and\nroom to spare; which is perhaps the reason why Scrooge thought he saw a\nlocomotive hearse going on before him in the gloom. Half-a-dozen\ngas-lamps out of the street wouldn\'t have lighted the entry too well, so\nyou may suppose that it was pretty dark with Scrooge\'s dip.\n\nUp Scrooge went, not caring a button for that. Darkness is cheap, and\nScrooge liked it. But, before he shut his heavy door, he walked through\nhis rooms to see that all was right. He had just enough recollection of\nthe face to desire to do that.\n\nSitting-room, bedroom, lumber-room. All as they should be. Nobody under\nthe table, nobody under the sofa; a small fire in the grate; spoon and\nbasin ready; and the little saucepan of gruel (Scrooge had a cold in his\nhead) upon the hob. Nobody under the bed; nobody in the closet; nobody\nin his dressing-gown, which was hanging up in a suspicious attitude\nagainst the wall. Lumber-room as usual. Old fire-guard, old shoes, two\nfish baskets, washing-stand on three legs, and a poker.\n\n[Illustration: _Nobody under the bed; nobody in the closet; nobody in\nhis dressing-gown, which was hanging up in a suspicious attitude against\nthe wall_]\n\nQuite satisfied, he closed his door, and locked himself in; double\nlocked himself in, which was not his custom. Thus secured against\nsurprise, he took off his cravat; put on his dressing-gown and slippers,\nand his nightcap; and sat down before the fire to take his gruel.\n\nIt was a very low fire indeed; nothing on such a bitter night. He was\nobliged to sit close to it, and brood\n######################\nOutput:\n\n: ("entity"<|>"Scrooge"<|>"person"<|>"Scrooge is a character who experiences various emotions and encounters supernatural phenomena.")##\n("entity"<|>"Marley"<|>"person"<|>"Marley is a deceased partner of Scrooge, appearing as a ghostly figure with a significant impact on Scrooge.")##\n("entity"<|>"Washington"<|>"location"<|>"Washington is a location where communications are being received, indicating its importance in the decision-making process.")##\n("entity"<|>"The City of London"<|>"location"<|>"The City of London is mentioned as a significant setting in the text.")##\n("entity"<|>"Operation: Dulce"<|>"mission"<|>"Operation: Dulce is described as a mission that has evolved to interact and prepare, indicating a significant shift in objectives and activities.")##\n("entity"<|>"The team"<|>"organization"<|>"The team is portrayed as a group of individuals who have transitioned from passive observers to active participants in a mission, showing a dynamic change in their role.")##\n("relationship"<|>"Scrooge"<|>"Marley"<|>"Scrooge encounters Marley\'s ghostly face, leading to a moment of shock and introspection."<|>"supernatural encounter, reflection"<|>8)##\n("relationship"<|>"The team"<|>"Washington"<|>"The team receives communications from Washington, which influences their decision-making process."<|>"decision-making, external influence"<|>7)##\n("relationship"<|>"The team"<|>"Operation: Dulce"<|>"The team is directly involved in Operation: Dulce, executing its evolved objectives and activities."<|>"mission evolution, active participation"<|>9)##\n("content_keywords"<|>"supernatural encounter, decision-making, introspection, mission evolution")<|COMPLETE|>\n: MANY entities were missed in the last extraction.

With an\nill-will Scrooge dismounted from his stool, and tacitly admitted the\nfact to the expectant clerk in the tank, who instantly snuffed his\ncandle out, and put on his hat.\n\n\'You\'ll want all day to-morrow, I suppose?\' said Scrooge.\n\n\'If quite convenient, sir.\'\n\n\'It\'s not convenient,\' said Scrooge, \'and it\'s not fair.

He lived in chambers which had\nonce belonged to his deceased partner. They were a gloomy suite of\nrooms, in a lowering pile of building up a yard, where it had so little\nbusiness to be, that one could scarcely help fancying it must have run\nthere when it was a young house, playing at hide-and-seek with other\nhouses, and have forgotten the way out again. It was old enough now, and\ndreary enough; for nobody lived in it but Scrooge, the other rooms\nbeing all let out as offices. The yard was so dark that even Scrooge,\nwho knew its every stone, was fain to grope with his hands. The fog and\nfrost so hung about the black old gateway of the house, that it seemed\nas if the Genius of the Weather sat in mournful meditation on the\nthreshold.\n\nNow, it is a fact that there was nothing at all particular about the\nknocker on the door, except that it was very large.

You\nwill, therefore, permit me to repeat, emphatically, that Marley was as\ndead as a door-nail.\n\nScrooge knew he was dead? Of course he did. How could it be otherwise?\nScrooge and he were partners for I don\'t know how many years. Scrooge\nwas his sole executor, his sole administrator, his sole assign, his sole\nresiduary legatee, his sole friend, and sole mourner. And even Scrooge\nwas not so dreadfully cut up by the sad event but that he was an\nexcellent man of business on the very day of the funeral, and solemnised\nit with an undoubted bargain.\n\nThe mention of Marley\'s funeral brings me back to the point I started\nfrom. There is no doubt that Marley was dead. This must be distinctly\nunderstood, or nothing wonderful can come of the story I am going to\nrelate. If we were not perfectly convinced that Hamlet\'s father died\nbefore the play began, there would be nothing more remarkable in his\ntaking a stroll at night, in an easterly wind, upon his own ramparts,\nthan there would be in any other middle-aged gentleman rashly turning\nout after dark in a breezy spot--say St. Paul\'s Churchyard, for\ninstance--literally to astonish his son\'s weak mind.\n\nScrooge never painted out Old Marley\'s name. There it stood, years\nafterwards, above the warehouse door: Scrooge and Marley. The firm was\nknown as Scrooge and Marley. Sometimes people new to the business called\nScrooge Scrooge, and sometimes Marley, but he answered to both names. It\nwas all the same to him.\n\nOh! but he was a tight-fisted hand at the grindstone, Scrooge! a\nsqueezing, wrenching, grasping, scraping, clutching, covetous old\nsinner! Hard and sharp as flint, from which no steel had ever struck out\ngenerous fire; secret, and self-contained, and solitary as an oyster.\nThe cold within him froze his old features, nipped his pointed nose,\nshrivelled his cheek, stiffened his gait; made his eyes red, his thin\nlips blue; and spoke out shrewdly in his grating voice. A frosty rime\nwas on his head, and on his eyebrows, and his wiry chin. He carried his\nown low temperature always about with him; he iced his office in the\ndog-days, and didn\'t thaw it one degree at Christmas.\n\nExternal heat and cold had little influence on Scrooge. No warmth could\nwarm, no wintry weather chill him. No wind that blew was bitterer than\nhe, no falling snow was more intent upon its purpose, no pelting rain\nless open to entreaty. Foul weather didn\'t know where to have him. The\nheaviest rain, and snow, and hail, and sleet could boast of the\nadvantage over him in only one respect. They often \'came down\'\nhandsomely, and Scrooge never did.\n\nNobody ever stopped him in the street to say, with gladsome looks, \'My\ndear Scrooge, how are you? When will you come to see me?\' No beggars\nimplored him to bestow a trifle, no children asked him what it was\no\'clock, no man or woman ever once in all his life inquired the way to\nsuch and such a place, of Scrooge. Even the blind men\'s dogs appeared to\nknow him; and, when they saw him coming on, would tug their owners into\ndoorways and up courts; and then would wag their tails as though they\nsaid, \'No eye at all is better than an evil eye, dark master!\'\n\nBut what did Scrooge care? It was the very thing he liked. To edge his\nway along the crowded paths of life, warning all human sympathy to keep\nits distance, was what the knowing ones call \'nuts\' to Scrooge.\n\nOnce upon a time--of all the good days in the year, on Christmas\nEve--old Scrooge sat busy in his counting-house.

It was cold, bleak,\nbiting weather; foggy withal; and he could hear the people in the court\noutside go wheezing up and down, beating their hands upon their breasts,\nand stamping their feet upon the pavement stones to warm them. The City\nclocks had only just gone three, but it was quite dark already--it had\nnot been light all day--and candles were flaring in the windows of the\nneighbouring offices, like ruddy smears upon the palpable brown air. The\nfog came pouring in at every chink and keyhole, and was so dense\nwithout, that, although the court was of the narrowest, the houses\nopposite were mere phantoms. To see the dingy cloud come drooping down,\nobscuring everything, one might have thought that nature lived hard by,\nand was brewing on a large scale.\n\nThe door of Scrooge\'s counting-house was open, that he might keep his\neye upon his clerk, who in a dismal little cell beyond, a sort of tank,\nwas copying letters. Scrooge had a very small fire, but the clerk\'s fire\nwas so very much smaller that it looked like one coal. But he couldn\'t\nreplenish it, for Scrooge kept the coal-box in his own room; and so\nsurely as the clerk came in with the shovel, the master predicted that\nit would be necessary for them to part. Wherefore the clerk put on his\nwhite comforter, and tried to warm himself at the candle; in which\neffort, not being a man of strong imagination, he failed.\n\n\'A merry Christmas, uncle! God save you!\' cried a cheerful voice. It was\nthe voice of Scrooge\'s nephew, who came upon him so quickly that this\nwas the first intimation he had of his approach.\n\n\'Bah!\' said Scrooge. \'Humbug!\'\n\nHe had so heated himself with rapid walking in the fog and frost, this\nnephew of Scrooge\'s, that he was all in a glow; his face was ruddy and\nhandsome; his eyes sparkled, and his breath smoked again.\n\n\'Christmas a humbug, uncle!\' said Scrooge\'s nephew. \'You don\'t mean\nthat, I am sure?\'\n\n\'I do,\' said Scrooge. \'Merry Christmas! What right have you to be merry?\nWhat reason have you to be merry? You\'re poor enough.\'\n\n\'Come, then,\' returned the nephew gaily. \'What right have you to be\ndismal? What reason have you to be morose? You\'re rich enough.\'\n\nScrooge, having no better answer ready on the spur of the moment, said,\n\'Bah!\' again; and followed it up with \'Humbug!\'\n\n\'Don\'t be cross, uncle!\' said the nephew.\n\n\'What else can I be,\' returned the uncle, \'when I live in such a world\nof fools as this? Merry Christmas! Out upon merry Christmas! What\'s\nChristmas-time to you but a time for paying bills without money; a time\nfor finding yourself a year older, and not an hour richer; a time for\nbalancing your books, and having every item in \'em through a round dozen\nof months presented dead against you? If I could work my will,\' said\nScrooge indignantly, \'every idiot who goes about with "Merry Christmas"\non his lips should be boiled with his own pudding, and buried with a\nstake of holly through his heart. He should!\'\n\n\'Uncle!\' pleaded the nephew.\n\n\'Nephew!\' returned the uncle sternly, \'keep Christmas in your own way,\nand let me keep it in mine.\'\n\n\'Keep it!\' repeated Scrooge\'s nephew. \'But you don\'t keep it.\'\n\n\'Let me leave it alone, then,\' said Scrooge. \'Much good may it do you!\nMuch good it has ever done you!\'\n\n\'There are many things from which I might have derived good, by which I\nhave not profited, I dare say,\' returned the nephew; \'Christmas among\nthe rest. But I am sure I have always thought of Christmas-time, when\nit has come round--apart from the veneration due to its sacred name and\norigin, if anything belonging to it can be apart from that--as a good\ntime; a kind, forgiving, charitable, pleasant time; the only time I know\nof, in the long calendar of the year, when men and women seem by one\nconsent to open their shut-up hearts freely, and to think of people\nbelow them as if they really were fellow-passengers to the grave,\n```\n'}]

And therefore,\nuncle, though it has never put a scrap of gold or silver in my pocket, I\nbelieve that it _has_ done me good and _will_ do me good; and I say, God\nbless it!\'\n\nThe clerk in the tank involuntarily applauded. Becoming immediately\nsensible of the impropriety, he poked the fire, and extinguished the\nlast frail spark for ever.\n\n\'Let me hear another sound from _you_,\' said Scrooge, \'and you\'ll keep\nyour Christmas by losing your situation! You\'re quite a powerful\nspeaker, sir,\' he added, turning to his nephew. \'I wonder you don\'t go\ninto Parliament.\'\n\n\'Don\'t be angry, uncle. Come! Dine with us to-morrow.\'\n\nScrooge said that he would see him----Yes, indeed he did. He went the\nwhole length of the expression, and said that he would see him in that\nextremity first.\n\n\'But why?\' cried Scrooge\'s nephew. \'Why?\'\n\n\'Why did you get married?\' said Scrooge.\n\n\'Because I fell in love.\'\n\n\'Because you fell in love!\' growled Scrooge, as if that were the only\none thing in the world more ridiculous than a merry Christmas. \'Good\nafternoon!\'\n\n\'Nay, uncle, but you never came to see me before that happened. Why give\nit as a reason for not coming now?\'\n\n\'Good afternoon,\' said Scrooge.\n\n\'I want nothing from you; I ask nothing of you; why cannot we be\nfriends?\'\n\n\'Good afternoon!\' said Scrooge.\n\n\'I am sorry, with all my heart, to find you so resolute. We have never\nhad any quarrel to which I have been a party. But I have made the trial\nin homage to Christmas, and I\'ll keep my Christmas humour to the last.\nSo A Merry Christmas, uncle!\'\n\n\'Good afternoon,\' said Scrooge.\n\n\'And A Happy New Year!\'\n\n\'Good afternoon!\' said Scrooge.\n\nHis nephew left the room without an angry word, notwithstanding. He\nstopped at the outer door to bestow the greetings of the season on the\nclerk, who, cold as he was, was warmer than Scrooge; for he returned\nthem cordially.\n\n\'There\'s another fellow,\' muttered Scrooge, who overheard him: \'my\nclerk, with fifteen shillings a week, and a wife and family, talking\nabout a merry Christmas. I\'ll retire to Bedlam.\'\n\nThis lunatic, in letting Scrooge\'s nephew out, had let two other people\nin. They were portly gentlemen, pleasant to behold, and now stood, with\ntheir hats off, in Scrooge\'s office. They had books and papers in their\nhands, and bowed to him.\n\n\'Scrooge and Marley\'s, I believe,\' said one of the gentlemen, referring\nto his list. \'Have I the pleasure of addressing Mr. Scrooge, or Mr.\nMarley?\'\n\n\'Mr. Marley has been dead these seven years,\' Scrooge replied. \'He died\nseven years ago, this very night.\'\n\n\'We have no doubt his liberality is well represented by his surviving\npartner,\' said the gentleman, presenting his credentials.\n\n[Illustration: THEY WERE PORTLY GENTLEMEN, PLEASANT TO BEHOLD]\n\nIt certainly was; for they had been two kindred spirits. At the ominous\nword \'liberality\' Scrooge frowned, and shook his head, and handed the\ncredentials back.\n\n\'At this festive season of the year, Mr. Scrooge,\' said the gentleman,\ntaking up a pen, \'it is more than usually desirable that we should make\nsome slight provision for the poor and destitute, who suffer greatly at\nthe present time. Many thousands are in want of common necessaries;\nhundreds of thousands are in want of common comforts, sir.\'\n\n\'Are there no prisons?\' asked Scrooge.\n\n\'Plenty of prisons,\' said the gentleman, laying down the pen again.\n\n\'And the Union workhouses?\' demanded Scrooge. \'Are they still\n```\n'}]

I was afraid, from what you said at first, that something had\noccurred to stop them in their useful course,\' said Scrooge. \'I am very\nglad to hear it.\'\n\n\'Under the impression that they scarcely furnish Christian cheer of mind\nor body to the multitude,\' returned the gentleman, \'a few of us are\nendeavouring to raise a fund to buy the Poor some meat and drink, and\nmeans of warmth. We choose this time, because it is a time, of all\nothers, when Want is keenly felt, and Abundance rejoices. What shall I\nput you down for?\'\n\n\'Nothing!\' Scrooge replied.\n\n\'You wish to be anonymous?\'\n\n\'I wish to be left alone,\' said Scrooge. \'Since you ask me what I wish,\ngentlemen, that is my answer. I don\'t make merry myself at Christmas,\nand I can\'t afford to make idle people merry. I help to support the\nestablishments I have mentioned--they cost enough: and those who are\nbadly off must go there.\'\n\n\'Many can\'t go there; and many would rather die.\'\n\n\'If they would rather die,\' said Scrooge, \'they had better do it, and\ndecrease the surplus population. Besides--excuse me--I don\'t know that.\'\n\n\'But you might know it,\' observed the gentleman.\n\n\'It\'s not my business,\' Scrooge returned. \'It\'s enough for a man to\nunderstand his own business, and not to interfere with other people\'s.\nMine occupies me constantly. Good afternoon, gentlemen!\'\n\nSeeing clearly that it would be useless to pursue their point, the\ngentlemen withdrew. Scrooge resumed his labours with an improved opinion\nof himself, and in a more facetious temper than was usual with him.\n\nMeanwhile the fog and darkness thickened so, that people ran about with\nflaring links, proffering their services to go before horses in\ncarriages, and conduct them on their way. The ancient tower of a church,\nwhose gruff old bell was always peeping slyly down at Scrooge out of a\nGothic window in the wall, became invisible, and struck the hours and\nquarters in the clouds, with tremulous vibrations afterwards, as if its\nteeth were chattering in its frozen head up there. The cold became\nintense. In the main street, at the corner of the court, some labourers\nwere repairing the gas-pipes, and had lighted a great fire in a brazier,\nround which a party of ragged men and boys were gathered: warming their\nhands and winking their eyes before the blaze in rapture. The water-plug\nbeing left in solitude, its overflowings suddenly congealed, and turned\nto misanthropic ice. The brightness of the shops, where holly sprigs and\nberries crackled in the lamp heat of the windows, made pale faces ruddy\nas they passed. Poulterers\' and grocers\' trades became a splendid joke:\na glorious pageant, with which it was next to impossible to believe that\nsuch dull principles as bargain and sale had anything to do. The Lord\nMayor, in the stronghold of the mighty Mansion House, gave orders to his\nfifty cooks and butlers to keep Christmas as a Lord Mayor\'s household\nshould; and even the little tailor, whom he had fined five shillings on\nthe previous Monday for being drunk and bloodthirsty in the streets,\nstirred up to-morrow\'s pudding in his garret, while his lean wife and\nthe baby sallied out to buy the beef.\n\nFoggier yet, and colder!

With an\nill-will Scrooge dismounted from his stool, and tacitly admitted the\nfact to the expectant clerk in the tank, who instantly snuffed his\ncandle out, and put on his hat.\n\n\'You\'ll want all day to-morrow, I suppose?\' said Scrooge.\n\n\'If quite convenient, sir.\'\n\n\'It\'s not convenient,\' said Scrooge, \'and it\'s not fair. If I was to\nstop half-a-crown for it, you\'d think yourself ill used, I\'ll be bound?\'\n\nThe clerk smiled faintly.\n\n\'And yet,\' said Scrooge, \'you don\'t think _me_ ill used when I pay a\nday\'s wages for no work.\'\n\n[Illustration: _Bob Cratchit went down a slide on Cornhill, at the end\nof a lane of boys, twenty times, in honour of its being Christmas\nEve_]\n\nThe clerk observed that it was only once a year.\n\n\'A poor excuse for picking a man\'s pocket every twenty-fifth of\nDecember!\' said Scrooge, buttoning his greatcoat to the chin. \'But I\nsuppose you must have the whole day. Be here all the earlier next\nmorning.\'\n\nThe clerk promised that he would; and Scrooge walked out with a growl.\nThe office was closed in a twinkling, and the clerk, with the long ends\nof his white comforter dangling below his waist (for he boasted no\ngreatcoat), went down a slide on Cornhill, at the end of a lane of boys,\ntwenty times, in honour of its being Christmas Eve, and then ran home to\nCamden Town as hard as he could pelt, to play at blind man\'s-buff.\n\nScrooge took his melancholy dinner in his usual melancholy tavern; and\nhaving read all the newspapers, and beguiled the rest of the evening\nwith his banker\'s book, went home to bed. He lived in chambers which had\nonce belonged to his deceased partner. They were a gloomy suite of\nrooms, in a lowering pile of building up a yard, where it had so little\nbusiness to be, that one could scarcely help fancying it must have run\nthere when it was a young house, playing at hide-and-seek with other\nhouses, and have forgotten the way out again. It was old enough now, and\ndreary enough; for nobody lived in it but Scrooge, the other rooms\nbeing all let out as offices. The yard was so dark that even Scrooge,\nwho knew its every stone, was fain to grope with his hands. The fog and\nfrost so hung about the black old gateway of the house, that it seemed\nas if the Genius of the Weather sat in mournful meditation on the\nthreshold.\n\nNow, it is a fact that there was nothing at all particular about the\nknocker on the door, except that it was very large. It is also a fact\nthat Scrooge had seen it, night and morning, during his whole residence\nin that place; also that Scrooge had as little of what is called fancy\nabout him as any man in the City of London, even including--which is a\nbold word--the corporation, aldermen, and livery. Let it also be borne\nin mind that Scrooge had not bestowed one thought on Marley since his\nlast mention of his seven-years\'-dead partner that afternoon. And then\nlet any man explain to me, if he can, how it happened that Scrooge,\nhaving his key in the lock of the door, saw in the knocker, without its\nundergoing any intermediate process of change--not a knocker, but\nMarley\'s face\n```\n'}]

It was not in impenetrable shadow, as the other objects\nin the yard were, but had a dismal light about it, like a bad lobster in\na dark cellar. It was not angry or ferocious, but looked at Scrooge as\nMarley used to look; with ghostly spectacles turned up on its ghostly\nforehead. The hair was curiously stirred, as if by breath or hot air;\nand, though the eyes were wide open, they were perfectly motionless.\nThat, and its livid colour, made it horrible; but its horror seemed to\nbe in spite of the face, and beyond its control, rather than a part of\nits own expression.\n\nAs Scrooge looked fixedly at this phenomenon, it was a knocker again.\n\nTo say that he was not startled, or that his blood was not conscious of\na terrible sensation to which it had been a stranger from infancy, would\nbe untrue. But he put his hand upon the key he had relinquished, turned\nit sturdily, walked in, and lighted his candle.\n\nHe _did_ pause, with a moment\'s irresolution, before he shut the door;\nand he _did_ look cautiously behind it first, as if he half expected to\nbe terrified with the sight of Marley\'s pigtail sticking out into the\nhall. But there was nothing on the back of the door, except the screws\nand nuts that held the knocker on, so he said, \'Pooh, pooh!\' and closed\nit with a bang.\n\nThe sound resounded through the house like thunder. Every room above,\nand every cask in the wine-merchant\'s cellars below, appeared to have a\nseparate peal of echoes of its own. Scrooge was not a man to be\nfrightened by echoes. He fastened the door, and walked across the hall,\nand up the stairs: slowly, too: trimming his candle as he went.\n\nYou may talk vaguely about driving a coach and six up a good old flight\nof stairs, or through a bad young Act of Parliament; but I mean to say\nyou might have got a hearse up that staircase, and taken it broadwise,\nwith the splinter-bar towards the wall, and the door towards the\nbalustrades: and done it easy. There was plenty of width for that, and\nroom to spare; which is perhaps the reason why Scrooge thought he saw a\nlocomotive hearse going on before him in the gloom. Half-a-dozen\ngas-lamps out of the street wouldn\'t have lighted the entry too well, so\nyou may suppose that it was pretty dark with Scrooge\'s dip.\n\nUp Scrooge went, not caring a button for that. Darkness is cheap, and\nScrooge liked it. But, before he shut his heavy door, he walked through\nhis rooms to see that all was right. He had just enough recollection of\nthe face to desire to do that.\n\nSitting-room, bedroom, lumber-room. All as they should be. Nobody under\nthe table, nobody under the sofa; a small fire in the grate; spoon and\nbasin ready; and the little saucepan of gruel (Scrooge had a cold in his\nhead) upon the hob. Nobody under the bed; nobody in the closet; nobody\nin his dressing-gown, which was hanging up in a suspicious attitude\nagainst the wall. Lumber-room as usual. Old fire-guard, old shoes, two\nfish baskets, washing-stand on three legs, and a poker.\n\n[Illustration: _Nobody under the bed; nobody in the closet; nobody in\nhis dressing-gown, which was hanging up in a suspicious attitude against\nthe wall_]\n\nQuite satisfied, he closed his door, and locked himself in; double\nlocked himself in, which was not his custom.

Let it also be borne\nin mind that Scrooge had not bestowed one thought on Marley since his\nlast mention of his seven-years\'-dead partner that afternoon. And then\nlet any man explain to me, if he can, how it happened that Scrooge,\nhaving his key in the lock of the door, saw in the knocker, without its\nundergoing any intermediate process of change--not a knocker, but\nMarley\'s face.\n\nMarley\'s face. It was not in impenetrable shadow, as the other objects\nin the yard were, but had a dismal light about it, like a bad lobster in\na dark cellar. It was not angry or ferocious, but looked at Scrooge as\nMarley used to look; with ghostly spectacles turned up on its ghostly\nforehead. The hair was curiously stirred, as if by breath or hot air;\nand, though the eyes were wide open, they were perfectly motionless.\nThat, and its livid colour, made it horrible; but its horror seemed to\nbe in spite of the face, and beyond its control, rather than a part of\nits own expression.\n\nAs Scrooge looked fixedly at this phenomenon, it was a knocker again.\n\nTo say that he was not startled, or that his blood was not conscious of\na terrible sensation to which it had been a stranger from infancy, would\nbe untrue. But he put his hand upon the key he had relinquished, turned\nit sturdily, walked in, and lighted his candle.\n\nHe _did_ pause, with a moment\'s irresolution, before he shut the door;\nand he _did_ look cautiously behind it first, as if he half expected to\nbe terrified with the sight of Marley\'s pigtail sticking out into the\nhall. But there was nothing on the back of the door, except the screws\nand nuts that held the knocker on, so he said, \'Pooh, pooh!\' and closed\nit with a bang.\n\nThe sound resounded through the house like thunder. Every room above,\nand every cask in the wine-merchant\'s cellars below, appeared to have a\nseparate peal of echoes of its own. Scrooge was not a man to be\nfrightened by echoes. He fastened the door, and walked across the hall,\nand up the stairs: slowly, too: trimming his candle as he went.\n\nYou may talk vaguely about driving a coach and six up a good old flight\nof stairs, or through a bad young Act of Parliament; but I mean to say\nyou might have got a hearse up that staircase, and taken it broadwise,\nwith the splinter-bar towards the wall, and the door towards the\nbalustrades: and done it easy. There was plenty of width for that, and\nroom to spare; which is perhaps the reason why Scrooge thought he saw a\nlocomotive hearse going on before him in the gloom. Half-a-dozen\ngas-lamps out of the street wouldn\'t have lighted the entry too well, so\nyou may suppose that it was pretty dark with Scrooge\'s dip.\n\nUp Scrooge went, not caring a button for that. Darkness is cheap, and\nScrooge liked it. But, before he shut his heavy door, he walked through\nhis rooms to see that all was right. He had just enough recollection of\nthe face to desire to do that.\n\nSitting-room, bedroom, lumber-room. All as they should be. Nobody under\nthe table, nobody under the sofa; a small fire in the grate; spoon and\nbasin ready; and the little saucepan of gruel (Scrooge had a cold in his\nhead) upon the hob. Nobody under the bed; nobody in the closet; nobody\nin his dressing-gown, which was hanging up in a suspicious attitude\nagainst the wall. Lumber-room as usual. Old fire-guard, old shoes, two\nfish baskets, washing-stand on three legs, and a poker.\n\n[Illustration: _Nobody under the bed; nobody in the closet; nobody in\nhis dressing-gown, which was hanging up in a suspicious attitude against\nthe wall_]\n\nQuite satisfied, he closed his door, and locked himself in; double\nlocked himself in, which was not his custom. Thus secured against\nsurprise, he took off his cravat; put on his dressing-gown and slippers,\nand his nightcap; and sat down before the fire to take his gruel.\n\nIt was a very low fire indeed; nothing on such a bitter night. He was\nobliged to sit close to it, and brood\n```\n\n{"named_entities": ["City of London", "Scrooge", "Marley", "Marley\'s face"]}\n'}]

You\nwill, therefore, permit me to repeat, emphatically, that Marley was as\ndead as a door-nail.\n\nScrooge knew he was dead? Of course he did. How could it be otherwise?\nScrooge and he were partners for I don\'t know how many years. Scrooge\nwas his sole executor, his sole administrator, his sole assign, his sole\nresiduary legatee, his sole friend, and sole mourner. And even Scrooge\nwas not so dreadfully cut up by the sad event but that he was an\nexcellent man of business on the very day of the funeral, and solemnised\nit with an undoubted bargain.\n\nThe mention of Marley\'s funeral brings me back to the point I started\nfrom. There is no doubt that Marley was dead. This must be distinctly\nunderstood, or nothing wonderful can come of the story I am going to\nrelate. If we were not perfectly convinced that Hamlet\'s father died\nbefore the play began, there would be nothing more remarkable in his\ntaking a stroll at night, in an easterly wind, upon his own ramparts,\nthan there would be in any other middle-aged gentleman rashly turning\nout after dark in a breezy spot--say St. Paul\'s Churchyard, for\ninstance--literally to astonish his son\'s weak mind.\n\nScrooge never painted out Old Marley\'s name. There it stood, years\nafterwards, above the warehouse door: Scrooge and Marley. The firm was\nknown as Scrooge and Marley. Sometimes people new to the business called\nScrooge Scrooge, and sometimes Marley, but he answered to both names. It\nwas all the same to him.\n\nOh! but he was a tight-fisted hand at the grindstone, Scrooge! a\nsqueezing, wrenching, grasping, scraping, clutching, covetous old\nsinner! Hard and sharp as flint, from which no steel had ever struck out\ngenerous fire; secret, and self-contained, and solitary as an oyster.\nThe cold within him froze his old features, nipped his pointed nose,\nshrivelled his cheek, stiffened his gait; made his eyes red, his thin\nlips blue; and spoke out shrewdly in his grating voice. A frosty rime\nwas on his head, and on his eyebrows, and his wiry chin. He carried his\nown low temperature always about with him; he iced his office in the\ndog-days, and didn\'t thaw it one degree at Christmas.\n\nExternal heat and cold had little influence on Scrooge. No warmth could\nwarm, no wintry weather chill him. No wind that blew was bitterer than\nhe, no falling snow was more intent upon its purpose, no pelting rain\nless open to entreaty. Foul weather didn\'t know where to have him. The\nheaviest rain, and snow, and hail, and sleet could boast of the\nadvantage over him in only one respect. They often \'came down\'\nhandsomely, and Scrooge never did.\n\nNobody ever stopped him in the street to say, with gladsome looks, \'My\ndear Scrooge, how are you? When will you come to see me?\' No beggars\nimplored him to bestow a trifle, no children asked him what it was\no\'clock, no man or woman ever once in all his life inquired the way to\nsuch and such a place, of Scrooge. Even the blind men\'s dogs appeared to\nknow him; and, when they saw him coming on, would tug their owners into\ndoorways and up courts; and then would wag their tails as though they\nsaid, \'No eye at all is better than an evil eye, dark master!\'\n\nBut what did Scrooge care? It was the very thing he liked. To edge his\nway along the crowded paths of life, warning all human sympathy to keep\nits distance, was what the knowing ones call \'nuts\' to Scrooge.\n\nOnce upon a time--of all the good days in the year, on Christmas\nEve--old Scrooge sat busy in his counting-house. It was cold, bleak,\nbiting weather; foggy withal; and he could hear the people in the court\noutside go wheezing up and down, beating their hands upon their breasts,\nand stamping their feet upon the pavement stones to warm them. The City\nclocks had only just gone three, but it was quite dark already--it had\nnot been light all day--and candles were flaring in the windows of\n```\n\n{"named_entities": ["Marley", "Scrooge", "Hamlet", "St. Paul\'s Churchyard", "Old Marley"]}\n'}]

But I am sure I have always thought of Christmas-time, when\nit has come round--apart from the veneration due to its sacred name and\norigin, if anything belonging to it can be apart from that--as a good\ntime; a kind, forgiving, charitable, pleasant time; the only time I know\nof, in the long calendar of the year, when men and women seem by one\nconsent to open their shut-up hearts freely, and to think of people\nbelow them as if they really were fellow-passengers to the grave, and\nnot another race of creatures bound on other journeys. And therefore,\nuncle, though it has never put a scrap of gold or silver in my pocket, I\nbelieve that it _has_ done me good and _will_ do me good; and I say, God\nbless it!\'\n\nThe clerk in the tank involuntarily applauded. Becoming immediately\nsensible of the impropriety, he poked the fire, and extinguished the\nlast frail spark for ever.\n\n\'Let me hear another sound from _you_,\' said Scrooge, \'and you\'ll keep\nyour Christmas by losing your situation! You\'re quite a powerful\nspeaker, sir,\' he added, turning to his nephew. \'I wonder you don\'t go\ninto Parliament.\'\n\n\'Don\'t be angry, uncle. Come! Dine with us to-morrow.\'\n\nScrooge said that he would see him----Yes, indeed he did. He went the\nwhole length of the expression, and said that he would see him in that\nextremity first.\n\n\'But why?\' cried Scrooge\'s nephew. \'Why?\'\n\n\'Why did you get married?\' said Scrooge.\n\n\'Because I fell in love.\'\n\n\'Because you fell in love!\' growled Scrooge, as if that were the only\none thing in the world more ridiculous than a merry Christmas. \'Good\nafternoon!\'\n\n\'Nay, uncle, but you never came to see me before that happened. Why give\nit as a reason for not coming now?\'\n\n\'Good afternoon,\' said Scrooge.\n\n\'I want nothing from you; I ask nothing of you; why cannot we be\nfriends?\'\n\n\'Good afternoon!\' said Scrooge.\n\n\'I am sorry, with all my heart, to find you so resolute. We have never\nhad any quarrel to which I have been a party. But I have made the trial\nin homage to Christmas, and I\'ll keep my Christmas humour to the last.\nSo A Merry Christmas, uncle!\'\n\n\'Good afternoon,\' said Scrooge.\n\n\'And A Happy New Year!\'\n\n\'Good afternoon!\' said Scrooge.\n\nHis nephew left the room without an angry word, notwithstanding. He\nstopped at the outer door to bestow the greetings of the season on the\nclerk, who, cold as he was, was warmer than Scrooge; for he returned\nthem cordially.\n\n\'There\'s another fellow,\' muttered Scrooge, who overheard him: \'my\nclerk, with fifteen shillings a week, and a wife and family, talking\nabout a merry Christmas. I\'ll retire to Bedlam.\'\n\nThis lunatic, in letting Scrooge\'s nephew out, had let two other people\nin. They were portly gentlemen, pleasant to behold, and now stood, with\ntheir hats off, in Scrooge\'s office. They had books and papers in their\nhands, and bowed to him.\n\n\'Scrooge and Marley\'s, I believe,\' said one of the gentlemen, referring\nto his list. \'Have I the pleasure of addressing Mr. Scrooge, or Mr.\nMarley?\'\n\n\'Mr. Marley has been dead these seven years,\' Scrooge replied. \'He died\nseven years ago, this very night.\'\n\n\'We have no doubt his liberality is well represented by his surviving\npartner,\' said the gentleman, presenting his credentials.\n\n[Illustration: THEY WERE PORTLY GENTLEMEN, PLEASANT TO BEHOLD]\n\nIt certainly was; for they had been two kindred spirits. At the ominous\nword \'liberality\' Scrooge frowned, and shook his head, and handed the\ncredentials back.\n\n\'At this festive season of the year, Mr. Scrooge,\' said the gentleman,\ntaking up a pen, \'it is more than usually desirable that we should make\nsome slight provision for the poor and destitute, who suffer greatly at\nthe present time.

Poulterers\' and grocers\' trades became a splendid joke:\na glorious pageant, with which it was next to impossible to believe that\nsuch dull principles as bargain and sale had anything to do.

I don\'t mean to say that I know of my own knowledge, what there is\nparticularly dead about a door-nail.

But the wisdom of our ancestors is in the simile; and my\nunhallowed hands shall not disturb it, or the country\'s done for. You\nwill, therefore, permit me to repeat, emphatically, that Marley was as\ndead as a door-nail.\n\nScrooge knew he was dead? Of course he did. How could it be otherwise?\nScrooge and he were partners for I don\'t know how many years. Scrooge\nwas his sole executor, his sole administrator, his sole assign, his sole\nresiduary legatee, his sole friend, and sole mourner.

Piercing, searching, biting cold. If the good\nSt. Dunstan had but nipped the Evil Spirit\'s nose with a touch of such\nweather as that, instead of using his familiar weapons, then indeed he\nwould have roared to lusty purpose. The owner of one scant young nose,\ngnawed and mumbled by the hungry cold as bones are gnawed by dogs,\nstooped down at Scrooge\'s keyhole to regale him with a Christmas carol;\nbut, at the first sound of\n\n  \'God bless you, merry gentleman,\n  May nothing you dismay!\'\n\nScrooge seized the ruler with such energy of action that the singer fled\nin terror, leaving the keyhole to the fog, and even more congenial\nfrost.\n\nAt length the hour of shutting up the counting-house arrived. With an\nill-will Scrooge dismounted from his stool, and tacitly admitted the\nfact to the expectant clerk in the tank, who instantly snuffed his\ncandle out, and put on his hat.\n\n\'You\'ll want all day to-morrow, I suppose?\' said Scrooge.\n\n\'If quite convenient, sir.\'\n\n\'It\'s not convenient,\' said Scrooge, \'and it\'s not fair. If I was to\nstop half-a-crown for it, you\'d think yourself ill used, I\'ll be bound?\'\n\nThe clerk smiled faintly.\n\n\'And yet,\' said Scrooge, \'you don\'t think _me_ ill used when I pay a\nday\'s wages for no work.\'\n\n[Illustration: _Bob Cratchit went down a slide on Cornhill, at the end\nof a lane of boys, twenty times, in honour of its being Christmas\nEve_]\n\nThe clerk observed that it was only once a year.\n\n\'A poor excuse for picking a man\'s pocket every twenty-fifth of\nDecember!\' said Scrooge, buttoning his greatcoat to the chin. \'But I\nsuppose you must have the whole day. Be here all the earlier next\nmorning.\'\n\nThe clerk promised that he would; and Scrooge walked out with a growl.\nThe office was closed in a twinkling, and the clerk, with the long ends\nof his white comforter dangling below his waist (for he boasted no\ngreatcoat), went down a slide on Cornhill, at the end of a lane of boys,\ntwenty times, in honour of its being Christmas Eve, and then ran home to\nCamden Town as hard as he could pelt, to play at blind man\'s-buff.\n\nScrooge took his melancholy dinner in his usual melancholy tavern; and\nhaving read all the newspapers, and beguiled the rest of the evening\nwith his banker\'s book, went home to bed. He lived in chambers which had\nonce belonged to his deceased partner. They were a gloomy suite of\nrooms, in a lowering pile of building up a yard, where it had so little\nbusiness to be, that one could scarcely help fancying it must have run\nthere when it was a young house, playing at hide-and-seek with other\nhouses, and have forgotten the way out again. It was old enough now, and\ndreary enough; for nobody lived in it but Scrooge, the other rooms\nbeing all let out as offices. The yard was so dark that even Scrooge,\nwho knew its every stone, was fain to grope with his hands. The fog and\nfrost so hung about the black old gateway of the house, that it seemed\nas if the Genius of the Weather sat in mournful meditation on the\nthreshold.\n\nNow, it is a fact that there was nothing at all particular about the\nknocker on the door, except that it was very large. It is also a fact\nthat Scrooge had seen it, night and morning, during his whole residence\nin that place; also that Scrooge had as little of what is called fancy\nabout him as any man in the City of London, even including--which is a\nbold word--the corporation, aldermen, and livery. Let it also be borne\nin mind that Scrooge had not bestowed one thought on Marley since his\nlast mention of his seven-years\'-dead partner that afternoon. And then\nlet any man explain to me, if he can, how it happened that Scrooge,\nhaving his key in the lock of the door, saw in the knocker, without its\nundergoing any intermediate process of change--not a knocker, but\nMarley\'s face\n```\n\n{"named_entities": ["Scrooge", "St. Dunstan", "Evil Spirit", "Christmas", "Bob Cratchit", "Cornhill", "Camden Town", "London", "Marley"]}\n'}]

It was cold, bleak,\nbiting weather; foggy withal; and he could hear the people in the court\noutside go wheezing up and down, beating their hands upon their breasts,\nand stamping their feet upon the pavement stones to warm them. The City\nclocks had only just gone three, but it was quite dark already--it had\nnot been light all day--and candles were flaring in the windows of the\nneighbouring offices, like ruddy smears upon the palpable brown air. The\nfog came pouring in at every chink and keyhole, and was so dense\nwithout, that, although the court was of the narrowest, the houses\nopposite were mere phantoms. To see the dingy cloud come drooping down,\nobscuring everything, one might have thought that nature lived hard by,\nand was brewing on a large scale.\n\nThe door of Scrooge\'s counting-house was open, that he might keep his\neye upon his clerk, who in a dismal little cell beyond, a sort of tank,\nwas copying letters. Scrooge had a very small fire, but the clerk\'s fire\nwas so very much smaller that it looked like one coal. But he couldn\'t\nreplenish it, for Scrooge kept the coal-box in his own room; and so\nsurely as the clerk came in with the shovel, the master predicted that\nit would be necessary for them to part. Wherefore the clerk put on his\nwhite comforter, and tried to warm himself at the candle; in which\neffort, not being a man of strong imagination, he failed.\n\n\'A merry Christmas, uncle! God save you!\' cried a cheerful voice. It was\nthe voice of Scrooge\'s nephew, who came upon him so quickly that this\nwas the first intimation he had of his approach.\n\n\'Bah!\' said Scrooge. \'Humbug!\'\n\nHe had so heated himself with rapid walking in the fog and frost, this\nnephew of Scrooge\'s, that he was all in a glow; his face was ruddy and\nhandsome; his eyes sparkled, and his breath smoked again.\n\n\'Christmas a humbug, uncle!\' said Scrooge\'s nephew. \'You don\'t mean\nthat, I am sure?\'\n\n\'I do,\' said Scrooge. \'Merry Christmas! What right have you to be merry?\nWhat reason have you to be merry? You\'re poor enough.\'\n\n\'Come, then,\' returned the nephew gaily. \'What right have you to be\ndismal? What reason have you to be morose? You\'re rich enough.\'\n\nScrooge, having no better answer ready on the spur of the moment, said,\n\'Bah!\' again; and followed it up with \'Humbug!\'\n\n\'Don\'t be cross, uncle!\' said the nephew.\n\n\'What else can I be,\' returned the uncle, \'when I live in such a world\nof fools as this? Merry Christmas! Out upon merry Christmas! What\'s\nChristmas-time to you but a time for paying bills without money; a time\nfor finding yourself a year older, and not an hour richer; a time for\nbalancing your books, and having every item in \'em through a round dozen\nof months presented dead against you? If I could work my will,\' said\nScrooge indignantly, \'every idiot who goes about with "Merry Christmas"\non his lips should be boiled with his own pudding, and buried with a\nstake of holly through his heart. He should!\'\n\n\'Uncle!\' pleaded the nephew.\n\n\'Nephew!\' returned the uncle sternly, \'keep Christmas in your own way,\nand let me keep it in mine.\'\n\n\'Keep it!\' repeated Scrooge\'s nephew. \'But you don\'t keep it.\'\n\n\'Let me leave it alone, then,\' said Scrooge. \'Much good may it do you!\nMuch good it has ever done you!\'\n\n\'There are many things from which I might have derived good, by which I\nhave not profited, I dare say,\' returned the nephew; \'Christmas among\nthe rest. But I am sure I have always thought of Christmas-time, when\nit has come round--apart from the veneration due to its sacred name and\norigin, if anything belonging to it can be apart from that--as a good\ntime; a kind, forgiving, charitable, pleasant time; the only time I know\nof, in the long calendar of the year, when men and women seem by one\nconsent to open their shut-up hearts freely, and to think of people\nbelow them as if they really were fellow-passengers to the grave,\n```\n\n{"named_entities": "[\\n    \\"Scrooge"}\n'}]

You\nwill, therefore, permit me to repeat, emphatically, that Marley was as\ndead as a door-nail.\n\nScrooge knew he was dead? Of course he did. How could it be otherwise?\nScrooge and he were partners for I don\'t know how many years. Scrooge\nwas his sole executor, his sole administrator, his sole assign, his sole\nresiduary legatee, his sole friend, and sole mourner. And even Scrooge\nwas not so dreadfully cut up by the sad event but that he was an\nexcellent man of business on the very day of the funeral, and solemnised\nit with an undoubted bargain.\n\nThe mention of Marley\'s funeral brings me back to the point I started\nfrom. There is no doubt that Marley was dead. This must be distinctly\nunderstood, or nothing wonderful can come of the story I am going to\nrelate. If we were not perfectly convinced that Hamlet\'s father died\nbefore the play began, there would be nothing more remarkable in his\ntaking a stroll at night, in an easterly wind, upon his own ramparts,\nthan there would be in any other middle-aged gentleman rashly turning\nout after dark in a breezy spot--say St. Paul\'s Churchyard, for\ninstance--literally to astonish his son\'s weak mind.\n\nScrooge never painted out Old Marley\'s name. There it stood, years\nafterwards, above the warehouse door: Scrooge and Marley. The firm was\nknown as Scrooge and Marley. Sometimes people new to the business called\nScrooge Scrooge, and sometimes Marley, but he answered to both names. It\nwas all the same to him.\n\nOh! but he was a tight-fisted hand at the grindstone, Scrooge! a\nsqueezing, wrenching, grasping, scraping, clutching, covetous old\nsinner! Hard and sharp as flint, from which no steel had ever struck out\ngenerous fire; secret, and self-contained, and solitary as an oyster.\nThe cold within him froze his old features, nipped his pointed nose,\nshrivelled his cheek, stiffened his gait; made his eyes red, his thin\nlips blue; and spoke out shrewdly in his grating voice. A frosty rime\nwas on his head, and on his eyebrows, and his wiry chin. He carried his\nown low temperature always about with him; he iced his office in the\ndog-days, and didn\'t thaw it one degree at Christmas.\n\nExternal heat and cold had little influence on Scrooge. No warmth could\nwarm, no wintry weather chill him. No wind that blew was bitterer than\nhe, no falling snow was more intent upon its purpose, no pelting rain\nless open to entreaty. Foul weather didn\'t know where to have him. The\nheaviest rain, and snow, and hail, and sleet could boast of the\nadvantage over him in only one respect. They often \'came down\'\nhandsomely, and Scrooge never did.\n\nNobody ever stopped him in the street to say, with gladsome looks, \'My\ndear Scrooge, how are you? When will you come to see me?\' No beggars\nimplored him to bestow a trifle, no children asked him what it was\no\'clock, no man or woman ever once in all his life inquired the way to\nsuch and such a place, of Scrooge. Even the blind men\'s dogs appeared to\nknow him; and, when they saw him coming on, would tug their owners into\ndoorways and up courts; and then would wag their tails as though they\nsaid, \'No eye at all is better than an evil eye, dark master!\'\n\nBut what did Scrooge care? It was the very thing he liked. To edge his\nway along the crowded paths of life, warning all human sympathy to keep\nits distance, was what the knowing ones call \'nuts\' to Scrooge.\n\nOnce upon a time--of all the good days in the year, on Christmas\nEve--old Scrooge sat busy in his counting-house.

It was cold, bleak,\nbiting weather; foggy withal; and he could hear the people in the court\noutside go wheezing up and down, beating their hands upon their breasts,\nand stamping their feet upon the pavement stones to warm them. The City\nclocks had only just gone three, but it was quite dark already--it had\nnot been light all day--and candles were flaring in the windows of the\nneighbouring offices, like ruddy smears upon the palpable brown air. The\nfog came pouring in at every chink and keyhole, and was so dense\nwithout, that, although the court was of the narrowest, the houses\nopposite were mere phantoms. To see the dingy cloud come drooping down,\nobscuring everything, one might have thought that nature lived hard by,\nand was brewing on a large scale.\n\nThe door of Scrooge\'s counting-house was open, that he might keep his\neye upon his clerk, who in a dismal little cell beyond, a sort of tank,\nwas copying letters. Scrooge had a very small fire, but the clerk\'s fire\nwas so very much smaller that it looked like one coal. But he couldn\'t\nreplenish it, for Scrooge kept the coal-box in his own room; and so\nsurely as the clerk came in with the shovel, the master predicted that\nit would be necessary for them to part. Wherefore the clerk put on his\nwhite comforter, and tried to warm himself at the candle; in which\neffort, not being a man of strong imagination, he failed.\n\n\'A merry Christmas, uncle! God save you!\' cried a cheerful voice. It was\nthe voice of Scrooge\'s nephew, who came upon him so quickly that this\nwas the first intimation he had of his approach.\n\n\'Bah!\' said Scrooge. \'Humbug!\'\n\nHe had so heated himself with rapid walking in the fog and frost, this\nnephew of Scrooge\'s, that he was all in a glow; his face was ruddy and\nhandsome; his eyes sparkled, and his breath smoked again.\n\n\'Christmas a humbug, uncle!\' said Scrooge\'s nephew. \'You don\'t mean\nthat, I am sure?\'\n\n\'I do,\' said Scrooge. \'Merry Christmas! What right have you to be merry?\nWhat reason have you to be merry? You\'re poor enough.\'\n\n\'Come, then,\' returned the nephew gaily. \'What right have you to be\ndismal? What reason have you to be morose? You\'re rich enough.\'\n\nScrooge, having no better answer ready on the spur of the moment, said,\n\'Bah!\' again; and followed it up with \'Humbug!\'\n\n\'Don\'t be cross, uncle!\' said the nephew.\n\n\'What else can I be,\' returned the uncle, \'when I live in such a world\nof fools as this? Merry Christmas! Out upon merry Christmas! What\'s\nChristmas-time to you but a time for paying bills without money; a time\nfor finding yourself a year older, and not an hour richer; a time for\nbalancing your books, and having every item in \'em through a round dozen\nof months presented dead against you? If I could work my will,\' said\nScrooge indignantly, \'every idiot who goes about with "Merry Christmas"\non his lips should be boiled with his own pudding, and buried with a\nstake of holly through his heart. He should!\'\n\n\'Uncle!\' pleaded the nephew.\n\n\'Nephew!\' returned the uncle sternly, \'keep Christmas in your own way,\nand let me keep it in mine.\'\n\n\'Keep it!\' repeated Scrooge\'s nephew. \'But you don\'t keep it.\'\n\n\'Let me leave it alone, then,\' said Scrooge. \'Much good may it do you!\nMuch good it has ever done you!\'\n\n\'There are many things from which I might have derived good, by which I\nhave not profited, I dare say,\' returned the nephew; \'Christmas among\nthe rest. But I am sure I have always thought of Christmas-time, when\nit has come round--apart from the veneration due to its sacred name and\norigin, if anything belonging to it can be apart from that--as a good\ntime; a kind, forgiving, charitable, pleasant time; the only time I know\nof, in the long calendar of the year, when men and women seem by one\nconsent to open their shut-up hearts freely, and to think of people\nbelow them as if they really were fellow-passengers to the grave,\n```\n'}]

And therefore,\nuncle, though it has never put a scrap of gold or silver in my pocket, I\nbelieve that it _has_ done me good and _will_ do me good; and I say, God\nbless it!\'\n\nThe clerk in the tank involuntarily applauded. Becoming immediately\nsensible of the impropriety, he poked the fire, and extinguished the\nlast frail spark for ever.\n\n\'Let me hear another sound from _you_,\' said Scrooge, \'and you\'ll keep\nyour Christmas by losing your situation! You\'re quite a powerful\nspeaker, sir,\' he added, turning to his nephew. \'I wonder you don\'t go\ninto Parliament.\'\n\n\'Don\'t be angry, uncle. Come! Dine with us to-morrow.\'\n\nScrooge said that he would see him----Yes, indeed he did. He went the\nwhole length of the expression, and said that he would see him in that\nextremity first.\n\n\'But why?\' cried Scrooge\'s nephew. \'Why?\'\n\n\'Why did you get married?\' said Scrooge.\n\n\'Because I fell in love.\'\n\n\'Because you fell in love!\' growled Scrooge, as if that were the only\none thing in the world more ridiculous than a merry Christmas. \'Good\nafternoon!\'\n\n\'Nay, uncle, but you never came to see me before that happened. Why give\nit as a reason for not coming now?\'\n\n\'Good afternoon,\' said Scrooge.\n\n\'I want nothing from you; I ask nothing of you; why cannot we be\nfriends?\'\n\n\'Good afternoon!\' said Scrooge.\n\n\'I am sorry, with all my heart, to find you so resolute. We have never\nhad any quarrel to which I have been a party. But I have made the trial\nin homage to Christmas, and I\'ll keep my Christmas humour to the last.\nSo A Merry Christmas, uncle!\'\n\n\'Good afternoon,\' said Scrooge.\n\n\'And A Happy New Year!\'\n\n\'Good afternoon!\' said Scrooge.\n\nHis nephew left the room without an angry word, notwithstanding. He\nstopped at the outer door to bestow the greetings of the season on the\nclerk, who, cold as he was, was warmer than Scrooge; for he returned\nthem cordially.\n\n\'There\'s another fellow,\' muttered Scrooge, who overheard him: \'my\nclerk, with fifteen shillings a week, and a wife and family, talking\nabout a merry Christmas. I\'ll retire to Bedlam.\'\n\nThis lunatic, in letting Scrooge\'s nephew out, had let two other people\nin. They were portly gentlemen, pleasant to behold, and now stood, with\ntheir hats off, in Scrooge\'s office. They had books and papers in their\nhands, and bowed to him.\n\n\'Scrooge and Marley\'s, I believe,\' said one of the gentlemen, referring\nto his list. \'Have I the pleasure of addressing Mr. Scrooge, or Mr.\nMarley?\'\n\n\'Mr. Marley has been dead these seven years,\' Scrooge replied. \'He died\nseven years ago, this very night.\'\n\n\'We have no doubt his liberality is well represented by his surviving\npartner,\' said the gentleman, presenting his credentials.\n\n[Illustration: THEY WERE PORTLY GENTLEMEN, PLEASANT TO BEHOLD]\n\nIt certainly was; for they had been two kindred spirits. At the ominous\nword \'liberality\' Scrooge frowned, and shook his head, and handed the\ncredentials back.\n\n\'At this festive season of the year, Mr. Scrooge,\' said the gentleman,\ntaking up a pen, \'it is more than usually desirable that we should make\nsome slight provision for the poor and destitute, who suffer greatly at\nthe present time. Many thousands are in want of common necessaries;\nhundreds of thousands are in want of common comforts, sir.\'\n\n\'Are there no prisons?\' asked Scrooge.\n\n\'Plenty of prisons,\' said the gentleman, laying down the pen again.\n\n\'And the Union workhouses?\' demanded Scrooge. \'Are they still\n```\n'}]

I was afraid, from what you said at first, that something had\noccurred to stop them in their useful course,\' said Scrooge. \'I am very\nglad to hear it.\'\n\n\'Under the impression that they scarcely furnish Christian cheer of mind\nor body to the multitude,\' returned the gentleman, \'a few of us are\nendeavouring to raise a fund to buy the Poor some meat and drink, and\nmeans of warmth. We choose this time, because it is a time, of all\nothers, when Want is keenly felt, and Abundance rejoices. What shall I\nput you down for?\'\n\n\'Nothing!\' Scrooge replied.\n\n\'You wish to be anonymous?\'\n\n\'I wish to be left alone,\' said Scrooge. \'Since you ask me what I wish,\ngentlemen, that is my answer. I don\'t make merry myself at Christmas,\nand I can\'t afford to make idle people merry. I help to support the\nestablishments I have mentioned--they cost enough: and those who are\nbadly off must go there.\'\n\n\'Many can\'t go there; and many would rather die.\'\n\n\'If they would rather die,\' said Scrooge, \'they had better do it, and\ndecrease the surplus population. Besides--excuse me--I don\'t know that.\'\n\n\'But you might know it,\' observed the gentleman.\n\n\'It\'s not my business,\' Scrooge returned. \'It\'s enough for a man to\nunderstand his own business, and not to interfere with other people\'s.\nMine occupies me constantly. Good afternoon, gentlemen!\'\n\nSeeing clearly that it would be useless to pursue their point, the\ngentlemen withdrew. Scrooge resumed his labours with an improved opinion\nof himself, and in a more facetious temper than was usual with him.\n\nMeanwhile the fog and darkness thickened so, that people ran about with\nflaring links, proffering their services to go before horses in\ncarriages, and conduct them on their way. The ancient tower of a church,\nwhose gruff old bell was always peeping slyly down at Scrooge out of a\nGothic window in the wall, became invisible, and struck the hours and\nquarters in the clouds, with tremulous vibrations afterwards, as if its\nteeth were chattering in its frozen head up there. The cold became\nintense. In the main street, at the corner of the court, some labourers\nwere repairing the gas-pipes, and had lighted a great fire in a brazier,\nround which a party of ragged men and boys were gathered: warming their\nhands and winking their eyes before the blaze in rapture. The water-plug\nbeing left in solitude, its overflowings suddenly congealed, and turned\nto misanthropic ice. The brightness of the shops, where holly sprigs and\nberries crackled in the lamp heat of the windows, made pale faces ruddy\nas they passed. Poulterers\' and grocers\' trades became a splendid joke:\na glorious pageant, with which it was next to impossible to believe that\nsuch dull principles as bargain and sale had anything to do. The Lord\nMayor, in the stronghold of the mighty Mansion House, gave orders to his\nfifty cooks and butlers to keep Christmas as a Lord Mayor\'s household\nshould; and even the little tailor, whom he had fined five shillings on\nthe previous Monday for being drunk and bloodthirsty in the streets,\nstirred up to-morrow\'s pudding in his garret, while his lean wife and\nthe baby sallied out to buy the beef.\n\nFoggier yet, and colder!

With an\nill-will Scrooge dismounted from his stool, and tacitly admitted the\nfact to the expectant clerk in the tank, who instantly snuffed his\ncandle out, and put on his hat.\n\n\'You\'ll want all day to-morrow, I suppose?\' said Scrooge.\n\n\'If quite convenient, sir.\'\n\n\'It\'s not convenient,\' said Scrooge, \'and it\'s not fair. If I was to\nstop half-a-crown for it, you\'d think yourself ill used, I\'ll be bound?\'\n\nThe clerk smiled faintly.\n\n\'And yet,\' said Scrooge, \'you don\'t think _me_ ill used when I pay a\nday\'s wages for no work.\'\n\n[Illustration: _Bob Cratchit went down a slide on Cornhill, at the end\nof a lane of boys, twenty times, in honour of its being Christmas\nEve_]\n\nThe clerk observed that it was only once a year.\n\n\'A poor excuse for picking a man\'s pocket every twenty-fifth of\nDecember!\' said Scrooge, buttoning his greatcoat to the chin. \'But I\nsuppose you must have the whole day. Be here all the earlier next\nmorning.\'\n\nThe clerk promised that he would; and Scrooge walked out with a growl.\nThe office was closed in a twinkling, and the clerk, with the long ends\nof his white comforter dangling below his waist (for he boasted no\ngreatcoat), went down a slide on Cornhill, at the end of a lane of boys,\ntwenty times, in honour of its being Christmas Eve, and then ran home to\nCamden Town as hard as he could pelt, to play at blind man\'s-buff.\n\nScrooge took his melancholy dinner in his usual melancholy tavern; and\nhaving read all the newspapers, and beguiled the rest of the evening\nwith his banker\'s book, went home to bed. He lived in chambers which had\nonce belonged to his deceased partner. They were a gloomy suite of\nrooms, in a lowering pile of building up a yard, where it had so little\nbusiness to be, that one could scarcely help fancying it must have run\nthere when it was a young house, playing at hide-and-seek with other\nhouses, and have forgotten the way out again. It was old enough now, and\ndreary enough; for nobody lived in it but Scrooge, the other rooms\nbeing all let out as offices. The yard was so dark that even Scrooge,\nwho knew its every stone, was fain to grope with his hands. The fog and\nfrost so hung about the black old gateway of the house, that it seemed\nas if the Genius of the Weather sat in mournful meditation on the\nthreshold.\n\nNow, it is a fact that there was nothing at all particular about the\nknocker on the door, except that it was very large. It is also a fact\nthat Scrooge had seen it, night and morning, during his whole residence\nin that place; also that Scrooge had as little of what is called fancy\nabout him as any man in the City of London, even including--which is a\nbold word--the corporation, aldermen, and livery. Let it also be borne\nin mind that Scrooge had not bestowed one thought on Marley since his\nlast mention of his seven-years\'-dead partner that afternoon. And then\nlet any man explain to me, if he can, how it happened that Scrooge,\nhaving his key in the lock of the door, saw in the knocker, without its\nundergoing any intermediate process of change--not a knocker, but\nMarley\'s face\n```\n'}]

It was not in impenetrable shadow, as the other objects\nin the yard were, but had a dismal light about it, like a bad lobster in\na dark cellar. It was not angry or ferocious, but looked at Scrooge as\nMarley used to look; with ghostly spectacles turned up on its ghostly\nforehead. The hair was curiously stirred, as if by breath or hot air;\nand, though the eyes were wide open, they were perfectly motionless.\nThat, and its livid colour, made it horrible; but its horror seemed to\nbe in spite of the face, and beyond its control, rather than a part of\nits own expression.\n\nAs Scrooge looked fixedly at this phenomenon, it was a knocker again.\n\nTo say that he was not startled, or that his blood was not conscious of\na terrible sensation to which it had been a stranger from infancy, would\nbe untrue. But he put his hand upon the key he had relinquished, turned\nit sturdily, walked in, and lighted his candle.\n\nHe _did_ pause, with a moment\'s irresolution, before he shut the door;\nand he _did_ look cautiously behind it first, as if he half expected to\nbe terrified with the sight of Marley\'s pigtail sticking out into the\nhall. But there was nothing on the back of the door, except the screws\nand nuts that held the knocker on, so he said, \'Pooh, pooh!\' and closed\nit with a bang.\n\nThe sound resounded through the house like thunder. Every room above,\nand every cask in the wine-merchant\'s cellars below, appeared to have a\nseparate peal of echoes of its own. Scrooge was not a man to be\nfrightened by echoes. He fastened the door, and walked across the hall,\nand up the stairs: slowly, too: trimming his candle as he went.\n\nYou may talk vaguely about driving a coach and six up a good old flight\nof stairs, or through a bad young Act of Parliament; but I mean to say\nyou might have got a hearse up that staircase, and taken it broadwise,\nwith the splinter-bar towards the wall, and the door towards the\nbalustrades: and done it easy. There was plenty of width for that, and\nroom to spare; which is perhaps the reason why Scrooge thought he saw a\nlocomotive hearse going on before him in the gloom. Half-a-dozen\ngas-lamps out of the street wouldn\'t have lighted the entry too well, so\nyou may suppose that it was pretty dark with Scrooge\'s dip.\n\nUp Scrooge went, not caring a button for that. Darkness is cheap, and\nScrooge liked it. But, before he shut his heavy door, he walked through\nhis rooms to see that all was right. He had just enough recollection of\nthe face to desire to do that.\n\nSitting-room, bedroom, lumber-room. All as they should be. Nobody under\nthe table, nobody under the sofa; a small fire in the grate; spoon and\nbasin ready; and the little saucepan of gruel (Scrooge had a cold in his\nhead) upon the hob. Nobody under the bed; nobody in the closet; nobody\nin his dressing-gown, which was hanging up in a suspicious attitude\nagainst the wall. Lumber-room as usual. Old fire-guard, old shoes, two\nfish baskets, washing-stand on three legs, and a poker.\n\n[Illustration: _Nobody under the bed; nobody in the closet; nobody in\nhis dressing-gown, which was hanging up in a suspicious attitude against\nthe wall_]\n\nQuite satisfied, he closed his door, and locked himself in; double\nlocked himself in, which was not his custom.

Let it also be borne\nin mind that Scrooge had not bestowed one thought on Marley since his\nlast mention of his seven-years\'-dead partner that afternoon. And then\nlet any man explain to me, if he can, how it happened that Scrooge,\nhaving his key in the lock of the door, saw in the knocker, without its\nundergoing any intermediate process of change--not a knocker, but\nMarley\'s face.\n\nMarley\'s face. It was not in impenetrable shadow, as the other objects\nin the yard were, but had a dismal light about it, like a bad lobster in\na dark cellar. It was not angry or ferocious, but looked at Scrooge as\nMarley used to look; with ghostly spectacles turned up on its ghostly\nforehead. The hair was curiously stirred, as if by breath or hot air;\nand, though the eyes were wide open, they were perfectly motionless.\nThat, and its livid colour, made it horrible; but its horror seemed to\nbe in spite of the face, and beyond its control, rather than a part of\nits own expression.\n\nAs Scrooge looked fixedly at this phenomenon, it was a knocker again.\n\nTo say that he was not startled, or that his blood was not conscious of\na terrible sensation to which it had been a stranger from infancy, would\nbe untrue. But he put his hand upon the key he had relinquished, turned\nit sturdily, walked in, and lighted his candle.\n\nHe _did_ pause, with a moment\'s irresolution, before he shut the door;\nand he _did_ look cautiously behind it first, as if he half expected to\nbe terrified with the sight of Marley\'s pigtail sticking out into the\nhall. But there was nothing on the back of the door, except the screws\nand nuts that held the knocker on, so he said, \'Pooh, pooh!\' and closed\nit with a bang.\n\nThe sound resounded through the house like thunder. Every room above,\nand every cask in the wine-merchant\'s cellars below, appeared to have a\nseparate peal of echoes of its own. Scrooge was not a man to be\nfrightened by echoes. He fastened the door, and walked across the hall,\nand up the stairs: slowly, too: trimming his candle as he went.\n\nYou may talk vaguely about driving a coach and six up a good old flight\nof stairs, or through a bad young Act of Parliament; but I mean to say\nyou might have got a hearse up that staircase, and taken it broadwise,\nwith the splinter-bar towards the wall, and the door towards the\nbalustrades: and done it easy. There was plenty of width for that, and\nroom to spare; which is perhaps the reason why Scrooge thought he saw a\nlocomotive hearse going on before him in the gloom. Half-a-dozen\ngas-lamps out of the street wouldn\'t have lighted the entry too well, so\nyou may suppose that it was pretty dark with Scrooge\'s dip.\n\nUp Scrooge went, not caring a button for that. Darkness is cheap, and\nScrooge liked it. But, before he shut his heavy door, he walked through\nhis rooms to see that all was right. He had just enough recollection of\nthe face to desire to do that.\n\nSitting-room, bedroom, lumber-room. All as they should be. Nobody under\nthe table, nobody under the sofa; a small fire in the grate; spoon and\nbasin ready; and the little saucepan of gruel (Scrooge had a cold in his\nhead) upon the hob. Nobody under the bed; nobody in the closet; nobody\nin his dressing-gown, which was hanging up in a suspicious attitude\nagainst the wall. Lumber-room as usual. Old fire-guard, old shoes, two\nfish baskets, washing-stand on three legs, and a poker.\n\n[Illustration: _Nobody under the bed; nobody in the closet; nobody in\nhis dressing-gown, which was hanging up in a suspicious attitude against\nthe wall_]\n\nQuite satisfied, he closed his door, and locked himself in; double\nlocked himself in, which was not his custom. Thus secured against\nsurprise, he took off his cravat; put on his dressing-gown and slippers,\nand his nightcap; and sat down before the fire to take his gruel.\n\nIt was a very low fire indeed; nothing on such a bitter night. He was\nobliged to sit close to it, and brood\n```\n\n{"named_entities": ["City of London", "Scrooge", "Marley", "Marley\'s face"]}\n'}]

But I am sure I have always thought of Christmas-time, when\nit has come round--apart from the veneration due to its sacred name and\norigin, if anything belonging to it can be apart from that--as a good\ntime; a kind, forgiving, charitable, pleasant time; the only time I know\nof, in the long calendar of the year, when men and women seem by one\nconsent to open their shut-up hearts freely, and to think of people\nbelow them as if they really were fellow-passengers to the grave, and\nnot another race of creatures bound on other journeys. And therefore,\nuncle, though it has never put a scrap of gold or silver in my pocket, I\nbelieve that it _has_ done me good and _will_ do me good; and I say, God\nbless it!\'\n\nThe clerk in the tank involuntarily applauded. Becoming immediately\nsensible of the impropriety, he poked the fire, and extinguished the\nlast frail spark for ever.\n\n\'Let me hear another sound from _you_,\' said Scrooge, \'and you\'ll keep\nyour Christmas by losing your situation! You\'re quite a powerful\nspeaker, sir,\' he added, turning to his nephew. \'I wonder you don\'t go\ninto Parliament.\'\n\n\'Don\'t be angry, uncle. Come! Dine with us to-morrow.\'\n\nScrooge said that he would see him----Yes, indeed he did. He went the\nwhole length of the expression, and said that he would see him in that\nextremity first.\n\n\'But why?\' cried Scrooge\'s nephew. \'Why?\'\n\n\'Why did you get married?\' said Scrooge.\n\n\'Because I fell in love.\'\n\n\'Because you fell in love!\' growled Scrooge, as if that were the only\none thing in the world more ridiculous than a merry Christmas. \'Good\nafternoon!\'\n\n\'Nay, uncle, but you never came to see me before that happened. Why give\nit as a reason for not coming now?\'\n\n\'Good afternoon,\' said Scrooge.\n\n\'I want nothing from you; I ask nothing of you; why cannot we be\nfriends?\'\n\n\'Good afternoon!\' said Scrooge.\n\n\'I am sorry, with all my heart, to find you so resolute. We have never\nhad any quarrel to which I have been a party. But I have made the trial\nin homage to Christmas, and I\'ll keep my Christmas humour to the last.\nSo A Merry Christmas, uncle!\'\n\n\'Good afternoon,\' said Scrooge.\n\n\'And A Happy New Year!\'\n\n\'Good afternoon!\' said Scrooge.\n\nHis nephew left the room without an angry word, notwithstanding. He\nstopped at the outer door to bestow the greetings of the season on the\nclerk, who, cold as he was, was warmer than Scrooge; for he returned\nthem cordially.\n\n\'There\'s another fellow,\' muttered Scrooge, who overheard him: \'my\nclerk, with fifteen shillings a week, and a wife and family, talking\nabout a merry Christmas. I\'ll retire to Bedlam.\'\n\nThis lunatic, in letting Scrooge\'s nephew out, had let two other people\nin. They were portly gentlemen, pleasant to behold, and now stood, with\ntheir hats off, in Scrooge\'s office. They had books and papers in their\nhands, and bowed to him.\n\n\'Scrooge and Marley\'s, I believe,\' said one of the gentlemen, referring\nto his list. \'Have I the pleasure of addressing Mr. Scrooge, or Mr.\nMarley?\'\n\n\'Mr. Marley has been dead these seven years,\' Scrooge replied. \'He died\nseven years ago, this very night.\'\n\n\'We have no doubt his liberality is well represented by his surviving\npartner,\' said the gentleman, presenting his credentials.\n\n[Illustration: THEY WERE PORTLY GENTLEMEN, PLEASANT TO BEHOLD]\n\nIt certainly was; for they had been two kindred spirits. At the ominous\nword \'liberality\' Scrooge frowned, and shook his head, and handed the\ncredentials back.\n\n\'At this festive season of the year, Mr. Scrooge,\' said the gentleman,\ntaking up a pen, \'it is more than usually desirable that we should make\nsome slight provision for the poor and destitute, who suffer greatly at\nthe present time. Many thousands are in want of common necessaries;\nhundreds of thousands are in want of common comforts, sir.\'\n\n\'Are there no prisons?\' asked Scrooge.\n\n\'Plenty of prisons,\' said the gentleman, laying down the pen again.\n\n\'And the Union workhouses?\' demanded Scrooge. \'Are they still\n```\n\n{"named_entities": ["Christmas", "Scrooge", "Parliament", "New Year", "Bedlam", "Marley"]}\n'}]

The owner of one scant young nose,\ngnawed and mumbled by the hungry cold as bones are gnawed by dogs,\nstooped down at Scrooge\'s keyhole to regale him with a Christmas carol;\nbut, at the first sound of\n\n  \'God bless you, merry gentleman,\n  May nothing you dismay!\'\n\nScrooge seized the ruler with such energy of action that the singer fled\nin terror, leaving the keyhole to the fog, and even more congenial\nfrost.\n\nAt length the hour of shutting up the counting-house arrived. With an\nill-will Scrooge dismounted from his stool, and tacitly admitted the\nfact to the expectant clerk in the tank, who instantly snuffed his\ncandle out, and put on his hat.\n\n\'You\'ll want all day to-morrow, I suppose?\' said Scrooge.\n\n\'If quite convenient, sir.\'\n\n\'It\'s not convenient,\' said Scrooge, \'and it\'s not fair. If I was to\nstop half-a-crown for it, you\'d think yourself ill used, I\'ll be bound?\'\n\nThe clerk smiled faintly.\n\n\'And yet,\' said Scrooge, \'you don\'t think _me_ ill used when I pay a\nday\'s wages for no work.\'\n\n[Illustration: _Bob Cratchit went down a slide on Cornhill, at the end\nof a lane of boys, twenty times, in honour of its being Christmas\nEve_]\n\nThe clerk observed that it was only once a year.\n\n\'A poor excuse for picking a man\'s pocket every twenty-fifth of\nDecember!\' said Scrooge, buttoning his greatcoat to the chin. \'But I\nsuppose you must have the whole day. Be here all the earlier next\nmorning.\'\n\nThe clerk promised that he would; and Scrooge walked out with a growl.\nThe office was closed in a twinkling, and the clerk, with the long ends\nof his white comforter dangling below his waist (for he boasted no\ngreatcoat), went down a slide on Cornhill, at the end of a lane of boys,\ntwenty times, in honour of its being Christmas Eve, and then ran home to\nCamden Town as hard as he could pelt, to play at blind man\'s-buff.\n\nScrooge took his melancholy dinner in his usual melancholy tavern; and\nhaving read all the newspapers, and beguiled the rest of the evening\nwith his banker\'s book, went home to bed. He lived in chambers which had\nonce belonged to his deceased partner. They were a gloomy suite of\nrooms, in a lowering pile of building up a yard, where it had so little\nbusiness to be, that one could scarcely help fancying it must have run\nthere when it was a young house, playing at hide-and-seek with other\nhouses, and have forgotten the way out again. It was old enough now, and\ndreary enough; for nobody lived in it but Scrooge, the other rooms\nbeing all let out as offices. The yard was so dark that even Scrooge,\nwho knew its every stone, was fain to grope with his hands. The fog and\nfrost so hung about the black old gateway of the house, that it seemed\nas if the Genius of the Weather sat in mournful meditation on the\nthreshold.\n\nNow, it is a fact that there was nothing at all particular about the\nknocker on the door, except that it was very large. It is also a fact\nthat Scrooge had seen it, night and morning, during his whole residence\nin that place; also that Scrooge had as little of what is called fancy\nabout him as any man in the City of London, even including--which is a\nbold word--the corporation, aldermen, and livery. Let it also be borne\nin mind that Scrooge had not bestowed one thought on Marley since his\nlast mention of his seven-years\'-dead partner that afternoon. And then\nlet any man explain to me, if he can, how it happened that Scrooge,\nhaving his key in the lock of the door, saw in the knocker, without its\nundergoing any intermediate process of change--not a knocker, but\nMarley\'s face\n```\n\n{"named_entities": ["Scrooge", "St. Dunstan", "Evil Spirit", "Christmas", "Bob Cratchit", "Cornhill", "Camden Town", "London", "Marley"]}\n'}]

You\nwill, therefore, permit me to repeat, emphatically, that Marley was as\ndead as a door-nail.\n\nScrooge knew he was dead? Of course he did. How could it be otherwise?\nScrooge and he were partners for I don\'t know how many years. Scrooge\nwas his sole executor, his sole administrator, his sole assign, his sole\nresiduary legatee, his sole friend, and sole mourner. And even Scrooge\nwas not so dreadfully cut up by the sad event but that he was an\nexcellent man of business on the very day of the funeral, and solemnised\nit with an undoubted bargain.\n\nThe mention of Marley\'s funeral brings me back to the point I started\nfrom. There is no doubt that Marley was dead. This must be distinctly\nunderstood, or nothing wonderful can come of the story I am going to\nrelate. If we were not perfectly convinced that Hamlet\'s father died\nbefore the play began, there would be nothing more remarkable in his\ntaking a stroll at night, in an easterly wind, upon his own ramparts,\nthan there would be in any other middle-aged gentleman rashly turning\nout after dark in a breezy spot--say St. Paul\'s Churchyard, for\ninstance--literally to astonish his son\'s weak mind.\n\nScrooge never painted out Old Marley\'s name. There it stood, years\nafterwards, above the warehouse door: Scrooge and Marley. The firm was\nknown as Scrooge and Marley. Sometimes people new to the business called\nScrooge Scrooge, and sometimes Marley, but he answered to both names. It\nwas all the same to him.\n\nOh! but he was a tight-fisted hand at the grindstone, Scrooge! a\nsqueezing, wrenching, grasping, scraping, clutching, covetous old\nsinner! Hard and sharp as flint, from which no steel had ever struck out\ngenerous fire; secret, and self-contained, and solitary as an oyster.\nThe cold within him froze his old features, nipped his pointed nose,\nshrivelled his cheek, stiffened his gait; made his eyes red, his thin\nlips blue; and spoke out shrewdly in his grating voice. A frosty rime\nwas on his head, and on his eyebrows, and his wiry chin. He carried his\nown low temperature always about with him; he iced his office in the\ndog-days, and didn\'t thaw it one degree at Christmas.\n\nExternal heat and cold had little influence on Scrooge. No warmth could\nwarm, no wintry weather chill him. No wind that blew was bitterer than\nhe, no falling snow was more intent upon its purpose, no pelting rain\nless open to entreaty. Foul weather didn\'t know where to have him. The\nheaviest rain, and snow, and hail, and sleet could boast of the\nadvantage over him in only one respect. They often \'came down\'\nhandsomely, and Scrooge never did.\n\nNobody ever stopped him in the street to say, with gladsome looks, \'My\ndear Scrooge, how are you? When will you come to see me?\' No beggars\nimplored him to bestow a trifle, no children asked him what it was\no\'clock, no man or woman ever once in all his life inquired the way to\nsuch and such a place, of Scrooge. Even the blind men\'s dogs appeared to\nknow him; and, when they saw him coming on, would tug their owners into\ndoorways and up courts; and then would wag their tails as though they\nsaid, \'No eye at all is better than an evil eye, dark master!\'\n\nBut what did Scrooge care? It was the very thing he liked. To edge his\nway along the crowded paths of life, warning all human sympathy to keep\nits distance, was what the knowing ones call \'nuts\' to Scrooge.\n\nOnce upon a time--of all the good days in the year, on Christmas\nEve--old Scrooge sat busy in his counting-house. It was cold, bleak,\nbiting weather; foggy withal; and he could hear the people in the court\noutside go wheezing up and down, beating their hands upon their breasts,\nand stamping their feet upon the pavement stones to warm them. The City\nclocks had only just gone three, but it was quite dark already--it had\nnot been light all day--and candles were flaring in the windows of\n```\n\n{"named_entities": ["Marley", "Scrooge", "Hamlet", "St. Paul\'s Churchyard", "Old Marley"]}\n'}]

It was cold, bleak,\nbiting weather; foggy withal; and he could hear the people in the court\noutside go wheezing up and down, beating their hands upon their breasts,\nand stamping their feet upon the pavement stones to warm them. The City\nclocks had only just gone three, but it was quite dark already--it had\nnot been light all day--and candles were flaring in the windows of the\nneighbouring offices, like ruddy smears upon the palpable brown air. The\nfog came pouring in at every chink and keyhole, and was so dense\nwithout, that, although the court was of the narrowest, the houses\nopposite were mere phantoms. To see the dingy cloud come drooping down,\nobscuring everything, one might have thought that nature lived hard by,\nand was brewing on a large scale.\n\nThe door of Scrooge\'s counting-house was open, that he might keep his\neye upon his clerk, who in a dismal little cell beyond, a sort of tank,\nwas copying letters. Scrooge had a very small fire, but the clerk\'s fire\nwas so very much smaller that it looked like one coal. But he couldn\'t\nreplenish it, for Scrooge kept the coal-box in his own room; and so\nsurely as the clerk came in with the shovel, the master predicted that\nit would be necessary for them to part. Wherefore the clerk put on his\nwhite comforter, and tried to warm himself at the candle; in which\neffort, not being a man of strong imagination, he failed.\n\n\'A merry Christmas, uncle! God save you!\' cried a cheerful voice. It was\nthe voice of Scrooge\'s nephew, who came upon him so quickly that this\nwas the first intimation he had of his approach.\n\n\'Bah!\' said Scrooge. \'Humbug!\'\n\nHe had so heated himself with rapid walking in the fog and frost, this\nnephew of Scrooge\'s, that he was all in a glow; his face was ruddy and\nhandsome; his eyes sparkled, and his breath smoked again.\n\n\'Christmas a humbug, uncle!\' said Scrooge\'s nephew. \'You don\'t mean\nthat, I am sure?\'\n\n\'I do,\' said Scrooge. \'Merry Christmas! What right have you to be merry?\nWhat reason have you to be merry? You\'re poor enough.\'\n\n\'Come, then,\' returned the nephew gaily. \'What right have you to be\ndismal? What reason have you to be morose? You\'re rich enough.\'\n\nScrooge, having no better answer ready on the spur of the moment, said,\n\'Bah!\' again; and followed it up with \'Humbug!\'\n\n\'Don\'t be cross, uncle!\' said the nephew.\n\n\'What else can I be,\' returned the uncle, \'when I live in such a world\nof fools as this? Merry Christmas! Out upon merry Christmas! What\'s\nChristmas-time to you but a time for paying bills without money; a time\nfor finding yourself a year older, and not an hour richer; a time for\nbalancing your books, and having every item in \'em through a round dozen\nof months presented dead against you? If I could work my will,\' said\nScrooge indignantly, \'every idiot who goes about with "Merry Christmas"\non his lips should be boiled with his own pudding, and buried with a\nstake of holly through his heart. He should!\'\n\n\'Uncle!\' pleaded the nephew.\n\n\'Nephew!\' returned the uncle sternly, \'keep Christmas in your own way,\nand let me keep it in mine.\'\n\n\'Keep it!\' repeated Scrooge\'s nephew. \'But you don\'t keep it.\'\n\n\'Let me leave it alone, then,\' said Scrooge. \'Much good may it do you!\nMuch good it has ever done you!\'\n\n\'There are many things from which I might have derived good, by which I\nhave not profited, I dare say,\' returned the nephew; \'Christmas among\nthe rest. But I am sure I have always thought of Christmas-time, when\nit has come round--apart from the veneration due to its sacred name and\norigin, if anything belonging to it can be apart from that--as a good\ntime; a kind, forgiving, charitable, pleasant time; the only time I know\nof, in the long calendar of the year, when men and women seem by one\nconsent to open their shut-up hearts freely, and to think of people\nbelow them as if they really were fellow-passengers to the grave,\n```\n\n{"named_entities": "[\\n    \\"Scrooge"}\n'}]

You\nwill, therefore, permit me to repeat, emphatically, that Marley was as\ndead as a door-nail.\n\nScrooge knew he was dead? Of course he did. How could it be otherwise?\nScrooge and he were partners for I don\'t know how many years. Scrooge\nwas his sole executor, his sole administrator, his sole assign, his sole\nresiduary legatee, his sole friend, and sole mourner. And even Scrooge\nwas not so dreadfully cut up by the sad event but that he was an\nexcellent man of business on the very day of the funeral, and solemnised\nit with an undoubted bargain.\n\nThe mention of Marley\'s funeral brings me back to the point I started\nfrom. There is no doubt that Marley was dead. This must be distinctly\nunderstood, or nothing wonderful can come of the story I am going to\nrelate. If we were not perfectly convinced that Hamlet\'s father died\nbefore the play began, there would be nothing more remarkable in his\ntaking a stroll at night, in an easterly wind, upon his own ramparts,\nthan there would be in any other middle-aged gentleman rashly turning\nout after dark in a breezy spot--say St. Paul\'s Churchyard, for\ninstance--literally to astonish his son\'s weak mind.\n\nScrooge never painted out Old Marley\'s name. There it stood, years\nafterwards, above the warehouse door: Scrooge and Marley. The firm was\nknown as Scrooge and Marley. Sometimes people new to the business called\nScrooge Scrooge, and sometimes Marley, but he answered to both names. It\nwas all the same to him.\n\nOh! but he was a tight-fisted hand at the grindstone, Scrooge! a\nsqueezing, wrenching, grasping, scraping, clutching, covetous old\nsinner! Hard and sharp as flint, from which no steel had ever struck out\ngenerous fire; secret, and self-contained, and solitary as an oyster.\nThe cold within him froze his old features, nipped his pointed nose,\nshrivelled his cheek, stiffened his gait; made his eyes red, his thin\nlips blue; and spoke out shrewdly in his grating voice. A frosty rime\nwas on his head, and on his eyebrows, and his wiry chin. He carried his\nown low temperature always about with him; he iced his office in the\ndog-days, and didn\'t thaw it one degree at Christmas.\n\nExternal heat and cold had little influence on Scrooge. No warmth could\nwarm, no wintry weather chill him. No wind that blew was bitterer than\nhe, no falling snow was more intent upon its purpose, no pelting rain\nless open to entreaty. Foul weather didn\'t know where to have him. The\nheaviest rain, and snow, and hail, and sleet could boast of the\nadvantage over him in only one respect. They often \'came down\'\nhandsomely, and Scrooge never did.\n\nNobody ever stopped him in the street to say, with gladsome looks, \'My\ndear Scrooge, how are you? When will you come to see me?\' No beggars\nimplored him to bestow a trifle, no children asked him what it was\no\'clock, no man or woman ever once in all his life inquired the way to\nsuch and such a place, of Scrooge. Even the blind men\'s dogs appeared to\nknow him; and, when they saw him coming on, would tug their owners into\ndoorways and up courts; and then would wag their tails as though they\nsaid, \'No eye at all is better than an evil eye, dark master!\'\n\nBut what did Scrooge care? It was the very thing he liked. To edge his\nway along the crowded paths of life, warning all human sympathy to keep\nits distance, was what the knowing ones call \'nuts\' to Scrooge.\n\nOnce upon a time--of all the good days in the year, on Christmas\nEve--old Scrooge sat busy in his counting-house. It was cold, bleak,\nbiting weather; foggy withal; and he could hear the people in the court\noutside go wheezing up and down, beating their hands upon their breasts,\nand stamping their feet upon the pavement stones to warm them. The City\nclocks had only just gone three, but it was quite dark already--it had\nnot been light all day--and candles were flaring in the windows of\n```\n'}]

It was cold, bleak,\nbiting weather; foggy withal; and he could hear the people in the court\noutside go wheezing up and down, beating their hands upon their breasts,\nand stamping their feet upon the pavement stones to warm them. The City\nclocks had only just gone three, but it was quite dark already--it had\nnot been light all day--and candles were flaring in the windows of the\nneighbouring offices, like ruddy smears upon the palpable brown air. The\nfog came pouring in at every chink and keyhole, and was so dense\nwithout, that, although the court was of the narrowest, the houses\nopposite were mere phantoms. To see the dingy cloud come drooping down,\nobscuring everything, one might have thought that nature lived hard by,\nand was brewing on a large scale.\n\nThe door of Scrooge\'s counting-house was open, that he might keep his\neye upon his clerk, who in a dismal little cell beyond, a sort of tank,\nwas copying letters. Scrooge had a very small fire, but the clerk\'s fire\nwas so very much smaller that it looked like one coal. But he couldn\'t\nreplenish it, for Scrooge kept the coal-box in his own room; and so\nsurely as the clerk came in with the shovel, the master predicted that\nit would be necessary for them to part. Wherefore the clerk put on his\nwhite comforter, and tried to warm himself at the candle; in which\neffort, not being a man of strong imagination, he failed.\n\n\'A merry Christmas, uncle! God save you!\' cried a cheerful voice. It was\nthe voice of Scrooge\'s nephew, who came upon him so quickly that this\nwas the first intimation he had of his approach.\n\n\'Bah!\' said Scrooge. \'Humbug!\'\n\nHe had so heated himself with rapid walking in the fog and frost, this\nnephew of Scrooge\'s, that he was all in a glow; his face was ruddy and\nhandsome; his eyes sparkled, and his breath smoked again.\n\n\'Christmas a humbug, uncle!\' said Scrooge\'s nephew. \'You don\'t mean\nthat, I am sure?\'\n\n\'I do,\' said Scrooge. \'Merry Christmas! What right have you to be merry?\nWhat reason have you to be merry? You\'re poor enough.\'\n\n\'Come, then,\' returned the nephew gaily. \'What right have you to be\ndismal? What reason have you to be morose? You\'re rich enough.\'\n\nScrooge, having no better answer ready on the spur of the moment, said,\n\'Bah!\' again; and followed it up with \'Humbug!\'\n\n\'Don\'t be cross, uncle!\' said the nephew.\n\n\'What else can I be,\' returned the uncle, \'when I live in such a world\nof fools as this? Merry Christmas! Out upon merry Christmas! What\'s\nChristmas-time to you but a time for paying bills without money; a time\nfor finding yourself a year older, and not an hour richer; a time for\nbalancing your books, and having every item in \'em through a round dozen\nof months presented dead against you? If I could work my will,\' said\nScrooge indignantly, \'every idiot who goes about with "Merry Christmas"\non his lips should be boiled with his own pudding, and buried with a\nstake of holly through his heart.

And therefore,\nuncle, though it has never put a scrap of gold or silver in my pocket, I\nbelieve that it _has_ done me good and _will_ do me good; and I say, God\nbless it!\'\n\nThe clerk in the tank involuntarily applauded. Becoming immediately\nsensible of the impropriety, he poked the fire, and extinguished the\nlast frail spark for ever.\n\n\'Let me hear another sound from _you_,\' said Scrooge, \'and you\'ll keep\nyour Christmas by losing your situation! You\'re quite a powerful\nspeaker, sir,\' he added, turning to his nephew. \'I wonder you don\'t go\ninto Parliament.\'\n\n\'Don\'t be angry, uncle. Come!

He went the\nwhole length of the expression, and said that he would see him in that\nextremity first.\n\n\'But why?\' cried Scrooge\'s nephew. \'Why?\'\n\n\'Why did you get married?\' said Scrooge.\n\n\'Because I fell in love.\'\n\n\'Because you fell in love!\' growled Scrooge, as if that were the only\none thing in the world more ridiculous than a merry Christmas. \'Good\nafternoon!\'\n\n\'Nay, uncle, but you never came to see me before that happened. Why give\nit as a reason for not coming now?\'\n\n\'Good afternoon,\' said Scrooge.\n\n\'I want nothing from you; I ask nothing of you; why cannot we be\nfriends?\'\n\n\'Good afternoon!\' said Scrooge.\n\n\'I am sorry, with all my heart, to find you so resolute. We have never\nhad any quarrel to which I have been a party. But I have made the trial\nin homage to Christmas, and I\'ll keep my Christmas humour to the last.\nSo A Merry Christmas, uncle!\'\n\n\'Good afternoon,\' said Scrooge.\n\n\'And A Happy New Year!\'\n\n\'Good afternoon!\' said Scrooge.\n\nHis nephew left the room without an angry word, notwithstanding. He\nstopped at the outer door to bestow the greetings of the season on the\nclerk, who, cold as he was, was warmer than Scrooge; for he returned\nthem cordially.\n\n\'There\'s another fellow,\' muttered Scrooge, who overheard him: \'my\nclerk, with fifteen shillings a week, and a wife and family, talking\nabout a merry Christmas. I\'ll retire to Bedlam.\'\n\nThis lunatic, in letting Scrooge\'s nephew out, had let two other people\nin. They were portly gentlemen, pleasant to behold, and now stood, with\ntheir hats off, in Scrooge\'s office. They had books and papers in their\nhands, and bowed to him.\n\n\'Scrooge and Marley\'s, I believe,\' said one of the gentlemen, referring\nto his list. \'Have I the pleasure of addressing Mr. Scrooge, or Mr.\nMarley?\'\n\n\'Mr. Marley has been dead these seven years,\' Scrooge replied. \'He died\nseven years ago, this very night.\'\n\n\'We have no doubt his liberality is well represented by his surviving\npartner,\' said the gentleman, presenting his credentials.\n\n[Illustration: THEY WERE PORTLY GENTLEMEN, PLEASANT TO BEHOLD]\n\nIt certainly was; for they had been two kindred spirits.

With an\nill-will Scrooge dismounted from his stool, and tacitly admitted the\nfact to the expectant clerk in the tank, who instantly snuffed his\ncandle out, and put on his hat.\n\n\'You\'ll want all day to-morrow, I suppose?\' said Scrooge.\n\n\'If quite convenient, sir.\'\n\n\'It\'s not convenient,\' said Scrooge, \'and it\'s not fair. If I was to\nstop half-a-crown for it, you\'d think yourself ill used, I\'ll be bound?\'\n\nThe clerk smiled faintly.\n\n\'And yet,\' said Scrooge, \'you don\'t think _me_ ill used when I pay a\nday\'s wages for no work.\'\n\n[Illustration: _Bob Cratchit went down a slide on Cornhill, at the end\nof a lane of boys, twenty times, in honour of its being Christmas\nEve_]\n\nThe clerk observed that it was only once a year.\n\n\'A poor excuse for picking a man\'s pocket every twenty-fifth of\nDecember!\' said Scrooge, buttoning his greatcoat to the chin. \'But I\nsuppose you must have the whole day.

He lived in chambers which had\nonce belonged to his deceased partner. They were a gloomy suite of\nrooms, in a lowering pile of building up a yard, where it had so little\nbusiness to be, that one could scarcely help fancying it must have run\nthere when it was a young house, playing at hide-and-seek with other\nhouses, and have forgotten the way out again. It was old enough now, and\ndreary enough; for nobody lived in it but Scrooge, the other rooms\nbeing all let out as offices. The yard was so dark that even Scrooge,\nwho knew its every stone, was fain to grope with his hands. The fog and\nfrost so hung about the black old gateway of the house, that it seemed\nas if the Genius of the Weather sat in mournful meditation on the\nthreshold.\n\nNow, it is a fact that there was nothing at all particular about the\nknocker on the door, except that it was very large. It is also a fact\nthat Scrooge had seen it, night and morning, during his whole residence\nin that place; also that Scrooge had as little of what is called fancy\nabout him as any man in the City of London, even including--which is a\nbold word--the corporation, aldermen, and livery.

It was not in impenetrable shadow, as the other objects\nin the yard were, but had a dismal light about it, like a bad lobster in\na dark cellar. It was not angry or ferocious, but looked at Scrooge as\nMarley used to look; with ghostly spectacles turned up on its ghostly\nforehead. The hair was curiously stirred, as if by breath or hot air;\nand, though the eyes were wide open, they were perfectly motionless.\nThat, and its livid colour, made it horrible; but its horror seemed to\nbe in spite of the face, and beyond its control, rather than a part of\nits own expression.\n\nAs Scrooge looked fixedly at this phenomenon, it was a knocker again.\n\nTo say that he was not startled, or that his blood was not conscious of\na terrible sensation to which it had been a stranger from infancy, would\nbe untrue. But he put his hand upon the key he had relinquished, turned\nit sturdily, walked in, and lighted his candle.\n\nHe _did_ pause, with a moment\'s irresolution, before he shut the door;\nand he _did_ look cautiously behind it first, as if he half expected to\nbe terrified with the sight of Marley\'s pigtail sticking out into the\nhall. But there was nothing on the back of the door, except the screws\nand nuts that held the knocker on, so he said, \'Pooh, pooh!\' and closed\nit with a bang.\n\nThe sound resounded through the house like thunder. Every room above,\nand every cask in the wine-merchant\'s cellars below, appeared to have a\nseparate peal of echoes of its own. Scrooge was not a man to be\nfrightened by echoes. He fastened the door, and walked across the hall,\nand up the stairs: slowly, too: trimming his candle as he went.\n\nYou may talk vaguely about driving a coach and six up a good old flight\nof stairs, or through a bad young Act of Parliament; but I mean to say\nyou might have got a hearse up that staircase, and taken it broadwise,\nwith the splinter-bar towards the wall, and the door towards the\nbalustrades: and done it easy. There was plenty of width for that, and\nroom to spare; which is perhaps the reason why Scrooge thought he saw a\nlocomotive hearse going on before him in the gloom. Half-a-dozen\ngas-lamps out of the street wouldn\'t have lighted the entry too well, so\nyou may suppose that it was pretty dark with Scrooge\'s dip.\n\nUp Scrooge went, not caring a button for that. Darkness is cheap, and\nScrooge liked it. But, before he shut his heavy door, he walked through\nhis rooms to see that all was right. He had just enough recollection of\nthe face to desire to do that.\n\nSitting-room, bedroom, lumber-room. All as they should be. Nobody under\nthe table, nobody under the sofa; a small fire in the grate; spoon and\nbasin ready; and the little saucepan of gruel (Scrooge had a cold in his\nhead) upon the hob. Nobody under the bed; nobody in the closet; nobody\nin his dressing-gown, which was hanging up in a suspicious attitude\nagainst the wall. Lumber-room as usual. Old fire-guard, old shoes, two\nfish baskets, washing-stand on three legs, and a poker.\n\n[Illustration: _Nobody under the bed; nobody in the closet; nobody in\nhis dressing-gown, which was hanging up in a suspicious attitude against\nthe wall_]\n\nQuite satisfied, he closed his door, and locked himself in; double\nlocked himself in, which was not his custom.

In the main street, at the corner of the court, some labourers\nwere repairing the gas-pipes, and had lighted a great fire in a brazier,\nround which a party of ragged men and boys were gathered: warming their\nhands and winking their eyes before the blaze in rapture. The water-plug\nbeing left in solitude, its overflowings suddenly congealed, and turned\nto misanthropic ice. The brightness of the shops, where holly sprigs and\nberries crackled in the lamp heat of the windows, made pale faces ruddy\nas they passed. Poulterers\' and grocers\' trades became a splendid joke:\na glorious pageant, with which it was next to impossible to believe that\nsuch dull principles as bargain and sale had anything to do. The Lord\nMayor, in the stronghold of the mighty Mansion House, gave orders to his\nfifty cooks and butlers to keep Christmas as a Lord Mayor\'s household\nshould; and even the little tailor, whom he had fined five shillings on\nthe previous Monday for being drunk and bloodthirsty in the streets,\nstirred up to-morrow\'s pudding in his garret, while his lean wife and\nthe baby sallied out to buy the beef.\n\nFoggier yet, and colder! Piercing, searching, biting cold. If the good\nSt. Dunstan had but nipped the Evil Spirit\'s nose with a touch of such\nweather as that, instead of using his familiar weapons, then indeed he\nwould have roared to lusty purpose. The owner of one scant young nose,\ngnawed and\n```\n\n{"named_entities": ["Scrooge", "Christmas", "Lord Mayor", "St. Dunstan"]}\n'}]

You\nwill, therefore, permit me to repeat, emphatically, that Marley was as\ndead as a door-nail.\n\nScrooge knew he was dead? Of course he did. How could it be otherwise?\nScrooge and he were partners for I don\'t know how many years. Scrooge\nwas his sole executor, his sole administrator, his sole assign, his sole\nresiduary legatee, his sole friend, and sole mourner. And even Scrooge\nwas not so dreadfully cut up by the sad event but that he was an\nexcellent man of business on the very day of the funeral, and solemnised\nit with an undoubted bargain.\n\nThe mention of Marley\'s funeral brings me back to the point I started\nfrom. There is no doubt that Marley was dead. This must be distinctly\nunderstood, or nothing wonderful can come of the story I am going to\nrelate. If we were not perfectly convinced that Hamlet\'s father died\nbefore the play began, there would be nothing more remarkable in his\ntaking a stroll at night, in an easterly wind, upon his own ramparts,\nthan there would be in any other middle-aged gentleman rashly turning\nout after dark in a breezy spot--say St. Paul\'s Churchyard, for\ninstance--literally to astonish his son\'s weak mind.\n\nScrooge never painted out Old Marley\'s name. There it stood, years\nafterwards, above the warehouse door: Scrooge and Marley. The firm was\nknown as Scrooge and Marley. Sometimes people new to the business called\nScrooge Scrooge, and sometimes Marley, but he answered to both names. It\nwas all the same to him.\n\nOh! but he was a tight-fisted hand at the grindstone, Scrooge! a\nsqueezing, wrenching, grasping, scraping, clutching, covetous old\nsinner! Hard and sharp as flint, from which no steel had ever struck out\ngenerous fire; secret, and self-contained, and solitary as an oyster.\nThe cold within him froze his old features, nipped his pointed nose,\nshrivelled his cheek, stiffened his gait; made his eyes red, his thin\nlips blue; and spoke out shrewdly in his grating voice. A frosty rime\nwas on his head, and on his eyebrows, and his wiry chin. He carried his\nown low temperature always about with him; he iced his office in the\ndog-days, and didn\'t thaw it one degree at Christmas.\n\nExternal heat and cold had little influence on Scrooge. No warmth could\nwarm, no wintry weather chill him. No wind that blew was bitterer than\nhe, no falling snow was more intent upon its purpose, no pelting rain\nless open to entreaty. Foul weather didn\'t know where to have him. The\nheaviest rain, and snow, and hail, and sleet could boast of the\nadvantage over him in only one respect. They often \'came down\'\nhandsomely, and Scrooge never did.\n\nNobody ever stopped him in the street to say, with gladsome looks, \'My\ndear Scrooge, how are you? When will you come to see me?\' No beggars\nimplored him to bestow a trifle, no children asked him what it was\no\'clock, no man or woman ever once in all his life inquired the way to\nsuch and such a place, of Scrooge. Even the blind men\'s dogs appeared to\nknow him; and, when they saw him coming on, would tug their owners into\ndoorways and up courts; and then would wag their tails as though they\nsaid, \'No eye at all is better than an evil eye, dark master!\'\n\nBut what did Scrooge care? It was the very thing he liked. To edge his\nway along the crowded paths of life, warning all human sympathy to keep\nits distance, was what the knowing ones call \'nuts\' to Scrooge.\n\nOnce upon a time--of all the good days in the year, on Christmas\nEve--old Scrooge sat busy in his counting-house. It was cold, bleak,\nbiting weather; foggy withal; and he could hear the people in the court\noutside go wheezing up and down, beating their hands upon their breasts,\nand stamping their feet upon the pavement stones to warm them. The City\nclocks had only just gone three, but it was quite dark already--it had\nnot been light all day--and candles were flaring in the windows of\n```\n\n{"named_entities": ["Marley", "Scrooge", "Hamlet", "St. Paul\'s Churchyard", "Old Marley"]}\n'}]

But I am sure I have always thought of Christmas-time, when\nit has come round--apart from the veneration due to its sacred name and\norigin, if anything belonging to it can be apart from that--as a good\ntime; a kind, forgiving, charitable, pleasant time; the only time I know\nof, in the long calendar of the year, when men and women seem by one\nconsent to open their shut-up hearts freely, and to think of people\nbelow them as if they really were fellow-passengers to the grave, and\nnot another race of creatures bound on other journeys. And therefore,\nuncle, though it has never put a scrap of gold or silver in my pocket, I\nbelieve that it _has_ done me good and _will_ do me good; and I say, God\nbless it!\'\n\nThe clerk in the tank involuntarily applauded. Becoming immediately\nsensible of the impropriety, he poked the fire, and extinguished the\nlast frail spark for ever.\n\n\'Let me hear another sound from _you_,\' said Scrooge, \'and you\'ll keep\nyour Christmas by losing your situation! You\'re quite a powerful\nspeaker, sir,\' he added, turning to his nephew. \'I wonder you don\'t go\ninto Parliament.\'\n\n\'Don\'t be angry, uncle. Come! Dine with us to-morrow.\'\n\nScrooge said that he would see him----Yes, indeed he did. He went the\nwhole length of the expression, and said that he would see him in that\nextremity first.\n\n\'But why?\' cried Scrooge\'s nephew. \'Why?\'\n\n\'Why did you get married?\' said Scrooge.\n\n\'Because I fell in love.\'\n\n\'Because you fell in love!\' growled Scrooge, as if that were the only\none thing in the world more ridiculous than a merry Christmas. \'Good\nafternoon!\'\n\n\'Nay, uncle, but you never came to see me before that happened. Why give\nit as a reason for not coming now?\'\n\n\'Good afternoon,\' said Scrooge.\n\n\'I want nothing from you; I ask nothing of you; why cannot we be\nfriends?\'\n\n\'Good afternoon!\' said Scrooge.\n\n\'I am sorry, with all my heart, to find you so resolute. We have never\nhad any quarrel to which I have been a party. But I have made the trial\nin homage to Christmas, and I\'ll keep my Christmas humour to the last.\nSo A Merry Christmas, uncle!\'\n\n\'Good afternoon,\' said Scrooge.\n\n\'And A Happy New Year!\'\n\n\'Good afternoon!\' said Scrooge.\n\nHis nephew left the room without an angry word, notwithstanding. He\nstopped at the outer door to bestow the greetings of the season on the\nclerk, who, cold as he was, was warmer than Scrooge; for he returned\nthem cordially.\n\n\'There\'s another fellow,\' muttered Scrooge, who overheard him: \'my\nclerk, with fifteen shillings a week, and a wife and family, talking\nabout a merry Christmas. I\'ll retire to Bedlam.\'\n\nThis lunatic, in letting Scrooge\'s nephew out, had let two other people\nin. They were portly gentlemen, pleasant to behold, and now stood, with\ntheir hats off, in Scrooge\'s office. They had books and papers in their\nhands, and bowed to him.\n\n\'Scrooge and Marley\'s, I believe,\' said one of the gentlemen, referring\nto his list. \'Have I the pleasure of addressing Mr. Scrooge, or Mr.\nMarley?\'\n\n\'Mr. Marley has been dead these seven years,\' Scrooge replied. \'He died\nseven years ago, this very night.\'\n\n\'We have no doubt his liberality is well represented by his surviving\npartner,\' said the gentleman, presenting his credentials.\n\n[Illustration: THEY WERE PORTLY GENTLEMEN, PLEASANT TO BEHOLD]\n\nIt certainly was; for they had been two kindred spirits. At the ominous\nword \'liberality\' Scrooge frowned, and shook his head, and handed the\ncredentials back.\n\n\'At this festive season of the year, Mr. Scrooge,\' said the gentleman,\ntaking up a pen, \'it is more than usually desirable that we should make\nsome slight provision for the poor and destitute, who suffer greatly at\nthe present time. Many thousands are in want of common necessaries;\nhundreds of thousands are in want of common comforts, sir.\'\n\n\'Are there no prisons?\' asked Scrooge.\n\n\'Plenty of prisons,\' said the gentleman, laying down the pen again.\n\n\'And the Union workhouses?\' demanded Scrooge. \'Are they still\n```\n\n{"named_entities": ["Christmas", "Scrooge", "Parliament", "New Year", "Bedlam", "Marley"]}\n'}]

Piercing, searching, biting cold. If the good\nSt. Dunstan had but nipped the Evil Spirit\'s nose with a touch of such\nweather as that, instead of using his familiar weapons, then indeed he\nwould have roared to lusty purpose. The owner of one scant young nose,\ngnawed and mumbled by the hungry cold as bones are gnawed by dogs,\nstooped down at Scrooge\'s keyhole to regale him with a Christmas carol;\nbut, at the first sound of\n\n  \'God bless you, merry gentleman,\n  May nothing you dismay!\'\n\nScrooge seized the ruler with such energy of action that the singer fled\nin terror, leaving the keyhole to the fog, and even more congenial\nfrost.\n\nAt length the hour of shutting up the counting-house arrived. With an\nill-will Scrooge dismounted from his stool, and tacitly admitted the\nfact to the expectant clerk in the tank, who instantly snuffed his\ncandle out, and put on his hat.\n\n\'You\'ll want all day to-morrow, I suppose?\' said Scrooge.\n\n\'If quite convenient, sir.\'\n\n\'It\'s not convenient,\' said Scrooge, \'and it\'s not fair. If I was to\nstop half-a-crown for it, you\'d think yourself ill used, I\'ll be bound?\'\n\nThe clerk smiled faintly.\n\n\'And yet,\' said Scrooge, \'you don\'t think _me_ ill used when I pay a\nday\'s wages for no work.\'\n\n[Illustration: _Bob Cratchit went down a slide on Cornhill, at the end\nof a lane of boys, twenty times, in honour of its being Christmas\nEve_]\n\nThe clerk observed that it was only once a year.\n\n\'A poor excuse for picking a man\'s pocket every twenty-fifth of\nDecember!\' said Scrooge, buttoning his greatcoat to the chin. \'But I\nsuppose you must have the whole day. Be here all the earlier next\nmorning.\'\n\nThe clerk promised that he would; and Scrooge walked out with a growl.\nThe office was closed in a twinkling, and the clerk, with the long ends\nof his white comforter dangling below his waist (for he boasted no\ngreatcoat), went down a slide on Cornhill, at the end of a lane of boys,\ntwenty times, in honour of its being Christmas Eve, and then ran home to\nCamden Town as hard as he could pelt, to play at blind man\'s-buff.\n\nScrooge took his melancholy dinner in his usual melancholy tavern; and\nhaving read all the newspapers, and beguiled the rest of the evening\nwith his banker\'s book, went home to bed. He lived in chambers which had\nonce belonged to his deceased partner. They were a gloomy suite of\nrooms, in a lowering pile of building up a yard, where it had so little\nbusiness to be, that one could scarcely help fancying it must have run\nthere when it was a young house, playing at hide-and-seek with other\nhouses, and have forgotten the way out again. It was old enough now, and\ndreary enough; for nobody lived in it but Scrooge, the other rooms\nbeing all let out as offices. The yard was so dark that even Scrooge,\nwho knew its every stone, was fain to grope with his hands. The fog and\nfrost so hung about the black old gateway of the house, that it seemed\nas if the Genius of the Weather sat in mournful meditation on the\nthreshold.\n\nNow, it is a fact that there was nothing at all particular about the\nknocker on the door, except that it was very large. It is also a fact\nthat Scrooge had seen it, night and morning, during his whole residence\nin that place; also that Scrooge had as little of what is called fancy\nabout him as any man in the City of London, even including--which is a\nbold word--the corporation, aldermen, and livery. Let it also be borne\nin mind that Scrooge had not bestowed one thought on Marley since his\nlast mention of his seven-years\'-dead partner that afternoon. And then\nlet any man explain to me, if he can, how it happened that Scrooge,\nhaving his key in the lock of the door, saw in the knocker, without its\nundergoing any intermediate process of change--not a knocker, but\nMarley\'s face\n```\n\n{"named_entities": ["Scrooge", "St. Dunstan", "Evil Spirit", "Christmas", "Bob Cratchit", "Cornhill", "Camden Town", "London", "Marley"]}\n'}]

Let it also be borne\nin mind that Scrooge had not bestowed one thought on Marley since his\nlast mention of his seven-years\'-dead partner that afternoon. And then\nlet any man explain to me, if he can, how it happened that Scrooge,\nhaving his key in the lock of the door, saw in the knocker, without its\nundergoing any intermediate process of change--not a knocker, but\nMarley\'s face.\n\nMarley\'s face. It was not in impenetrable shadow, as the other objects\nin the yard were, but had a dismal light about it, like a bad lobster in\na dark cellar. It was not angry or ferocious, but looked at Scrooge as\nMarley used to look; with ghostly spectacles turned up on its ghostly\nforehead. The hair was curiously stirred, as if by breath or hot air;\nand, though the eyes were wide open, they were perfectly motionless.\nThat, and its livid colour, made it horrible; but its horror seemed to\nbe in spite of the face, and beyond its control, rather than a part of\nits own expression.\n\nAs Scrooge looked fixedly at this phenomenon, it was a knocker again.\n\nTo say that he was not startled, or that his blood was not conscious of\na terrible sensation to which it had been a stranger from infancy, would\nbe untrue. But he put his hand upon the key he had relinquished, turned\nit sturdily, walked in, and lighted his candle.\n\nHe _did_ pause, with a moment\'s irresolution, before he shut the door;\nand he _did_ look cautiously behind it first, as if he half expected to\nbe terrified with the sight of Marley\'s pigtail sticking out into the\nhall. But there was nothing on the back of the door, except the screws\nand nuts that held the knocker on, so he said, \'Pooh, pooh!\' and closed\nit with a bang.\n\nThe sound resounded through the house like thunder. Every room above,\nand every cask in the wine-merchant\'s cellars below, appeared to have a\nseparate peal of echoes of its own. Scrooge was not a man to be\nfrightened by echoes. He fastened the door, and walked across the hall,\nand up the stairs: slowly, too: trimming his candle as he went.\n\nYou may talk vaguely about driving a coach and six up a good old flight\nof stairs, or through a bad young Act of Parliament; but I mean to say\nyou might have got a hearse up that staircase, and taken it broadwise,\nwith the splinter-bar towards the wall, and the door towards the\nbalustrades: and done it easy. There was plenty of width for that, and\nroom to spare; which is perhaps the reason why Scrooge thought he saw a\nlocomotive hearse going on before him in the gloom. Half-a-dozen\ngas-lamps out of the street wouldn\'t have lighted the entry too well, so\nyou may suppose that it was pretty dark with Scrooge\'s dip.\n\nUp Scrooge went, not caring a button for that. Darkness is cheap, and\nScrooge liked it. But, before he shut his heavy door, he walked through\nhis rooms to see that all was right. He had just enough recollection of\nthe face to desire to do that.\n\nSitting-room, bedroom, lumber-room. All as they should be. Nobody under\nthe table, nobody under the sofa; a small fire in the grate; spoon and\nbasin ready; and the little saucepan of gruel (Scrooge had a cold in his\nhead) upon the hob. Nobody under the bed; nobody in the closet; nobody\nin his dressing-gown, which was hanging up in a suspicious attitude\nagainst the wall. Lumber-room as usual. Old fire-guard, old shoes, two\nfish baskets, washing-stand on three legs, and a poker.\n\n[Illustration: _Nobody under the bed; nobody in the closet; nobody in\nhis dressing-gown, which was hanging up in a suspicious attitude against\nthe wall_]\n\nQuite satisfied, he closed his door, and locked himself in; double\nlocked himself in, which was not his custom. Thus secured against\nsurprise, he took off his cravat; put on his dressing-gown and slippers,\nand his nightcap; and sat down before the fire to take his gruel.\n\nIt was a very low fire indeed; nothing on such a bitter night. He was\nobliged to sit close to it, and brood\n```\n\n{"named_entities": ["City of London", "Scrooge", "Marley", "Marley\'s face"]}\n'}]

It was cold, bleak,\nbiting weather; foggy withal; and he could hear the people in the court\noutside go wheezing up and down, beating their hands upon their breasts,\nand stamping their feet upon the pavement stones to warm them. The City\nclocks had only just gone three, but it was quite dark already--it had\nnot been light all day--and candles were flaring in the windows of the\nneighbouring offices, like ruddy smears upon the palpable brown air. The\nfog came pouring in at every chink and keyhole, and was so dense\nwithout, that, although the court was of the narrowest, the houses\nopposite were mere phantoms. To see the dingy cloud come drooping down,\nobscuring everything, one might have thought that nature lived hard by,\nand was brewing on a large scale.\n\nThe door of Scrooge\'s counting-house was open, that he might keep his\neye upon his clerk, who in a dismal little cell beyond, a sort of tank,\nwas copying letters. Scrooge had a very small fire, but the clerk\'s fire\nwas so very much smaller that it looked like one coal. But he couldn\'t\nreplenish it, for Scrooge kept the coal-box in his own room; and so\nsurely as the clerk came in with the shovel, the master predicted that\nit would be necessary for them to part. Wherefore the clerk put on his\nwhite comforter, and tried to warm himself at the candle; in which\neffort, not being a man of strong imagination, he failed.\n\n\'A merry Christmas, uncle! God save you!\' cried a cheerful voice. It was\nthe voice of Scrooge\'s nephew, who came upon him so quickly that this\nwas the first intimation he had of his approach.\n\n\'Bah!\' said Scrooge. \'Humbug!\'\n\nHe had so heated himself with rapid walking in the fog and frost, this\nnephew of Scrooge\'s, that he was all in a glow; his face was ruddy and\nhandsome; his eyes sparkled, and his breath smoked again.\n\n\'Christmas a humbug, uncle!\' said Scrooge\'s nephew. \'You don\'t mean\nthat, I am sure?\'\n\n\'I do,\' said Scrooge. \'Merry Christmas! What right have you to be merry?\nWhat reason have you to be merry? You\'re poor enough.\'\n\n\'Come, then,\' returned the nephew gaily. \'What right have you to be\ndismal? What reason have you to be morose? You\'re rich enough.\'\n\nScrooge, having no better answer ready on the spur of the moment, said,\n\'Bah!\' again; and followed it up with \'Humbug!\'\n\n\'Don\'t be cross, uncle!\' said the nephew.\n\n\'What else can I be,\' returned the uncle, \'when I live in such a world\nof fools as this? Merry Christmas! Out upon merry Christmas! What\'s\nChristmas-time to you but a time for paying bills without money; a time\nfor finding yourself a year older, and not an hour richer; a time for\nbalancing your books, and having every item in \'em through a round dozen\nof months presented dead against you? If I could work my will,\' said\nScrooge indignantly, \'every idiot who goes about with "Merry Christmas"\non his lips should be boiled with his own pudding, and buried with a\nstake of holly through his heart. He should!\'\n\n\'Uncle!\' pleaded the nephew.\n\n\'Nephew!\' returned the uncle sternly, \'keep Christmas in your own way,\nand let me keep it in mine.\'\n\n\'Keep it!\' repeated Scrooge\'s nephew. \'But you don\'t keep it.\'\n\n\'Let me leave it alone, then,\' said Scrooge. \'Much good may it do you!\nMuch good it has ever done you!\'\n\n\'There are many things from which I might have derived good, by which I\nhave not profited, I dare say,\' returned the nephew; \'Christmas among\nthe rest. But I am sure I have always thought of Christmas-time, when\nit has come round--apart from the veneration due to its sacred name and\norigin, if anything belonging to it can be apart from that--as a good\ntime; a kind, forgiving, charitable, pleasant time; the only time I know\nof, in the long calendar of the year, when men and women seem by one\nconsent to open their shut-up hearts freely, and to think of people\nbelow them as if they really were fellow-passengers to the grave,\n```\n\n{"named_entities": "[\\n    \\"Scrooge"}\n'}]

Scrooge\nwas his sole executor, his sole administrator, his sole assign, his sole\nresiduary legatee, his sole friend, and sole mourner. And even Scrooge\nwas not so dreadfully cut up by the sad event but that he was an\nexcellent man of business on the very day of the funeral, and solemnised\nit with an undoubted bargain.\n\nThe mention of Marley\'s funeral brings me back to the point I started\nfrom. There is no doubt that Marley was dead. This must be distinctly\nunderstood, or nothing wonderful can come of the story I am going to\nrelate. If we were not perfectly convinced that Hamlet\'s father died\nbefore the play began, there would be nothing more remarkable in his\ntaking a stroll at night, in an easterly wind, upon his own ramparts,\nthan there would be in any other middle-aged gentleman rashly turning\nout after dark in a breezy spot--say St. Paul\'s Churchyard, for\ninstance--literally to astonish his son\'s weak mind.\n\nScrooge never painted out Old Marley\'s name. There it stood, years\nafterwards, above the warehouse door: Scrooge and Marley. The firm was\nknown as Scrooge and Marley. Sometimes people new to the business called\nScrooge Scrooge, and sometimes Marley, but he answered to both names. It\nwas all the same to him.\n\nOh! but he was a tight-fisted hand at the grindstone, Scrooge! a\nsqueezing, wrenching, grasping, scraping, clutching, covetous old\nsinner! Hard and sharp as flint, from which no steel had ever struck out\ngenerous fire; secret, and self-contained, and solitary as an oyster.\nThe cold within him froze his old features, nipped his pointed nose,\nshrivelled his cheek, stiffened his gait; made his eyes red, his thin\nlips blue; and spoke out shrewdly in his grating voice. A frosty rime\nwas on his head, and on his eyebrows, and his wiry chin. He carried his\nown low temperature always about with him; he iced his office in the\ndog-days, and didn\'t thaw it one degree at Christmas.\n\nExternal heat and cold had little influence on Scrooge. No warmth could\nwarm, no wintry weather chill him. No wind that blew was bitterer than\nhe, no falling snow was more intent upon its purpose, no pelting rain\nless open to entreaty. Foul weather didn\'t know where to have him. The\nheaviest rain, and snow, and hail, and sleet could boast of the\nadvantage over him in only one respect. They often \'came down\'\nhandsomely, and Scrooge never did.\n\nNobody ever stopped him in the street to say, with gladsome looks, \'My\ndear Scrooge, how are you? When will you come to see me?\' No beggars\nimplored him to bestow a trifle, no children asked him what it was\no\'clock, no man or woman ever once in all his life inquired the way to\nsuch and such a place, of Scrooge. Even the blind men\'s dogs appeared to\nknow him; and, when they saw him coming on, would tug their owners into\ndoorways and up courts; and then would wag their tails as though they\nsaid, \'No eye at all is better than an evil eye, dark master!\'\n\nBut what did Scrooge care? It was the very thing he liked. To edge his\nway along the crowded paths of life, warning all human sympathy to keep\nits distance, was what the knowing ones call \'nuts\' to Scrooge.\n\nOnce upon a time--of all the good days in the year, on Christmas\nEve--old Scrooge sat busy in his counting-house. It was cold, bleak,\nbiting weather; foggy withal; and he could hear the people in the court\noutside go wheezing up and down, beating their hands upon their breasts,\nand stamping their feet upon the pavement stones to warm them.

It was cold, bleak,\nbiting weather; foggy withal; and he could hear the people in the court\noutside go wheezing up and down, beating their hands upon their breasts,\nand stamping their feet upon the pavement stones to warm them. The City\nclocks had only just gone three, but it was quite dark already--it had\nnot been light all day--and candles were flaring in the windows of the\nneighbouring offices, like ruddy smears upon the palpable brown air. The\nfog came pouring in at every chink and keyhole, and was so dense\nwithout, that, although the court was of the narrowest, the houses\nopposite were mere phantoms. To see the dingy cloud come drooping down,\nobscuring everything, one might have thought that nature lived hard by,\nand was brewing on a large scale.\n\nThe door of Scrooge\'s counting-house was open, that he might keep his\neye upon his clerk, who in a dismal little cell beyond, a sort of tank,\nwas copying letters. Scrooge had a very small fire, but the clerk\'s fire\nwas so very much smaller that it looked like one coal. But he couldn\'t\nreplenish it, for Scrooge kept the coal-box in his own room; and so\nsurely as the clerk came in with the shovel, the master predicted that\nit would be necessary for them to part. Wherefore the clerk put on his\nwhite comforter, and tried to warm himself at the candle; in which\neffort, not being a man of strong imagination, he failed.\n\n\'A merry Christmas, uncle! God save you!\' cried a cheerful voice. It was\nthe voice of Scrooge\'s nephew, who came upon him so quickly that this\nwas the first intimation he had of his approach.\n\n\'Bah!\' said Scrooge. \'Humbug!\'\n\nHe had so heated himself with rapid walking in the fog and frost, this\nnephew of Scrooge\'s, that he was all in a glow; his face was ruddy and\nhandsome; his eyes sparkled, and his breath smoked again.\n\n\'Christmas a humbug, uncle!\' said Scrooge\'s nephew. \'You don\'t mean\nthat, I am sure?\'\n\n\'I do,\' said Scrooge. \'Merry Christmas! What right have you to be merry?\nWhat reason have you to be merry? You\'re poor enough.\'\n\n\'Come, then,\' returned the nephew gaily. \'What right have you to be\ndismal? What reason have you to be morose? You\'re rich enough.\'\n\nScrooge, having no better answer ready on the spur of the moment, said,\n\'Bah!\' again; and followed it up with \'Humbug!\'\n\n\'Don\'t be cross, uncle!\' said the nephew.\n\n\'What else can I be,\' returned the uncle, \'when I live in such a world\nof fools as this? Merry Christmas! Out upon merry Christmas! What\'s\nChristmas-time to you but a time for paying bills without money; a time\nfor finding yourself a year older, and not an hour richer; a time for\nbalancing your books, and having every item in \'em through a round dozen\nof months presented dead against you? If I could work my will,\' said\nScrooge indignantly, \'every idiot who goes about with "Merry Christmas"\non his lips should be boiled with his own pudding, and buried with a\nstake of holly through his heart. He should!\'\n\n\'Uncle!\' pleaded the nephew.\n\n\'Nephew!\' returned the uncle sternly, \'keep Christmas in your own way,\nand let me keep it in mine.\'\n\n\'Keep it!\' repeated Scrooge\'s nephew. \'But you don\'t keep it.\'\n\n\'Let me leave it alone, then,\' said Scrooge. \'Much good may it do you!\nMuch good it has ever done you!\'\n\n\'There are many things from which I might have derived good, by which I\nhave not profited, I dare say,\' returned the nephew; \'Christmas among\nthe rest. But I am sure I have always thought of Christmas-time, when\nit has come round--apart from the veneration due to its sacred name and\norigin, if anything belonging to it can be apart from that--as a good\ntime; a kind, forgiving, charitable, pleasant time; the only time I know\nof, in the long calendar of the year, when men and women seem by one\nconsent to open their shut-up hearts freely, and to think of people\nbelow them as if they really were fellow-passengers to the grave,\n```\n'}]

And therefore,\nuncle, though it has never put a scrap of gold or silver in my pocket, I\nbelieve that it _has_ done me good and _will_ do me good; and I say, God\nbless it!\'\n\nThe clerk in the tank involuntarily applauded. Becoming immediately\nsensible of the impropriety, he poked the fire, and extinguished the\nlast frail spark for ever.\n\n\'Let me hear another sound from _you_,\' said Scrooge, \'and you\'ll keep\nyour Christmas by losing your situation! You\'re quite a powerful\nspeaker, sir,\' he added, turning to his nephew. \'I wonder you don\'t go\ninto Parliament.\'\n\n\'Don\'t be angry, uncle. Come! Dine with us to-morrow.\'\n\nScrooge said that he would see him----Yes, indeed he did. He went the\nwhole length of the expression, and said that he would see him in that\nextremity first.\n\n\'But why?\' cried Scrooge\'s nephew. \'Why?\'\n\n\'Why did you get married?\' said Scrooge.\n\n\'Because I fell in love.\'\n\n\'Because you fell in love!\' growled Scrooge, as if that were the only\none thing in the world more ridiculous than a merry Christmas. \'Good\nafternoon!\'\n\n\'Nay, uncle, but you never came to see me before that happened. Why give\nit as a reason for not coming now?\'\n\n\'Good afternoon,\' said Scrooge.\n\n\'I want nothing from you; I ask nothing of you; why cannot we be\nfriends?\'\n\n\'Good afternoon!\' said Scrooge.\n\n\'I am sorry, with all my heart, to find you so resolute. We have never\nhad any quarrel to which I have been a party. But I have made the trial\nin homage to Christmas, and I\'ll keep my Christmas humour to the last.\nSo A Merry Christmas, uncle!\'\n\n\'Good afternoon,\' said Scrooge.\n\n\'And A Happy New Year!\'\n\n\'Good afternoon!\' said Scrooge.\n\nHis nephew left the room without an angry word, notwithstanding. He\nstopped at the outer door to bestow the greetings of the season on the\nclerk, who, cold as he was, was warmer than Scrooge; for he returned\nthem cordially.\n\n\'There\'s another fellow,\' muttered Scrooge, who overheard him: \'my\nclerk, with fifteen shillings a week, and a wife and family, talking\nabout a merry Christmas. I\'ll retire to Bedlam.\'\n\nThis lunatic, in letting Scrooge\'s nephew out, had let two other people\nin. They were portly gentlemen, pleasant to behold, and now stood, with\ntheir hats off, in Scrooge\'s office. They had books and papers in their\nhands, and bowed to him.\n\n\'Scrooge and Marley\'s, I believe,\' said one of the gentlemen, referring\nto his list. \'Have I the pleasure of addressing Mr. Scrooge, or Mr.\nMarley?\'\n\n\'Mr. Marley has been dead these seven years,\' Scrooge replied. \'He died\nseven years ago, this very night.\'\n\n\'We have no doubt his liberality is well represented by his surviving\npartner,\' said the gentleman, presenting his credentials.\n\n[Illustration: THEY WERE PORTLY GENTLEMEN, PLEASANT TO BEHOLD]\n\nIt certainly was; for they had been two kindred spirits. At the ominous\nword \'liberality\' Scrooge frowned, and shook his head, and handed the\ncredentials back.\n\n\'At this festive season of the year, Mr. Scrooge,\' said the gentleman,\ntaking up a pen, \'it is more than usually desirable that we should make\nsome slight provision for the poor and destitute, who suffer greatly at\nthe present time. Many thousands are in want of common necessaries;\nhundreds of thousands are in want of common comforts, sir.\'\n\n\'Are there no prisons?\' asked Scrooge.\n\n\'Plenty of prisons,\' said the gentleman, laying down the pen again.\n\n\'And the Union workhouses?\' demanded Scrooge. \'Are they still\n```\n'}]

I don\'t make merry myself at Christmas,\nand I can\'t afford to make idle people merry. I help to support the\nestablishments I have mentioned--they cost enough: and those who are\nbadly off must go there.\'\n\n\'Many can\'t go there; and many would rather die.\'\n\n\'If they would rather die,\' said Scrooge, \'they had better do it, and\ndecrease the surplus population. Besides--excuse me--I don\'t know that.\'\n\n\'But you might know it,\' observed the gentleman.\n\n\'It\'s not my business,\' Scrooge returned. \'It\'s enough for a man to\nunderstand his own business, and not to interfere with other people\'s.\nMine occupies me constantly. Good afternoon, gentlemen!\'\n\nSeeing clearly that it would be useless to pursue their point, the\ngentlemen withdrew. Scrooge resumed his labours with an improved opinion\nof himself, and in a more facetious temper than was usual with him.\n\nMeanwhile the fog and darkness thickened so, that people ran about with\nflaring links, proffering their services to go before horses in\ncarriages, and conduct them on their way. The ancient tower of a church,\nwhose gruff old bell was always peeping slyly down at Scrooge out of a\nGothic window in the wall, became invisible, and struck the hours and\nquarters in the clouds, with tremulous vibrations afterwards, as if its\nteeth were chattering in its frozen head up there. The cold became\nintense. In the main street, at the corner of the court, some labourers\nwere repairing the gas-pipes, and had lighted a great fire in a brazier,\nround which a party of ragged men and boys were gathered: warming their\nhands and winking their eyes before the blaze in rapture. The water-plug\nbeing left in solitude, its overflowings suddenly congealed, and turned\nto misanthropic ice. The brightness of the shops, where holly sprigs and\nberries crackled in the lamp heat of the windows, made pale faces ruddy\nas they passed. Poulterers\' and grocers\' trades became a splendid joke:\na glorious pageant, with which it was next to impossible to believe that\nsuch dull principles as bargain and sale had anything to do. The Lord\nMayor, in the stronghold of the mighty Mansion House, gave orders to his\nfifty cooks and butlers to keep Christmas as a Lord Mayor\'s household\nshould; and even the little tailor, whom he had fined five shillings on\nthe previous Monday for being drunk and bloodthirsty in the streets,\nstirred up to-morrow\'s pudding in his garret, while his lean wife and\nthe baby sallied out to buy the beef.\n\nFoggier yet, and colder!

With an\nill-will Scrooge dismounted from his stool, and tacitly admitted the\nfact to the expectant clerk in the tank, who instantly snuffed his\ncandle out, and put on his hat.\n\n\'You\'ll want all day to-morrow, I suppose?\' said Scrooge.\n\n\'If quite convenient, sir.\'\n\n\'It\'s not convenient,\' said Scrooge, \'and it\'s not fair. If I was to\nstop half-a-crown for it, you\'d think yourself ill used, I\'ll be bound?\'\n\nThe clerk smiled faintly.\n\n\'And yet,\' said Scrooge, \'you don\'t think _me_ ill used when I pay a\nday\'s wages for no work.\'\n\n[Illustration: _Bob Cratchit went down a slide on Cornhill, at the end\nof a lane of boys, twenty times, in honour of its being Christmas\nEve_]\n\nThe clerk observed that it was only once a year.\n\n\'A poor excuse for picking a man\'s pocket every twenty-fifth of\nDecember!\' said Scrooge, buttoning his greatcoat to the chin. \'But I\nsuppose you must have the whole day. Be here all the earlier next\nmorning.\'\n\nThe clerk promised that he would; and Scrooge walked out with a growl.\nThe office was closed in a twinkling, and the clerk, with the long ends\nof his white comforter dangling below his waist (for he boasted no\ngreatcoat), went down a slide on Cornhill, at the end of a lane of boys,\ntwenty times, in honour of its being Christmas Eve, and then ran home to\nCamden Town as hard as he could pelt, to play at blind man\'s-buff.\n\nScrooge took his melancholy dinner in his usual melancholy tavern; and\nhaving read all the newspapers, and beguiled the rest of the evening\nwith his banker\'s book, went home to bed. He lived in chambers which had\nonce belonged to his deceased partner. They were a gloomy suite of\nrooms, in a lowering pile of building up a yard, where it had so little\nbusiness to be, that one could scarcely help fancying it must have run\nthere when it was a young house, playing at hide-and-seek with other\nhouses, and have forgotten the way out again. It was old enough now, and\ndreary enough; for nobody lived in it but Scrooge, the other rooms\nbeing all let out as offices. The yard was so dark that even Scrooge,\nwho knew its every stone, was fain to grope with his hands. The fog and\nfrost so hung about the black old gateway of the house, that it seemed\nas if the Genius of the Weather sat in mournful meditation on the\nthreshold.\n\nNow, it is a fact that there was nothing at all particular about the\nknocker on the door, except that it was very large. It is also a fact\nthat Scrooge had seen it, night and morning, during his whole residence\nin that place; also that Scrooge had as little of what is called fancy\nabout him as any man in the City of London, even including--which is a\nbold word--the corporation, aldermen, and livery. Let it also be borne\nin mind that Scrooge had not bestowed one thought on Marley since his\nlast mention of his seven-years\'-dead partner that afternoon. And then\nlet any man explain to me, if he can, how it happened that Scrooge,\nhaving his key in the lock of the door, saw in the knocker, without its\nundergoing any intermediate process of change--not a knocker, but\nMarley\'s face\n```\n'}]

It was not in impenetrable shadow, as the other objects\nin the yard were, but had a dismal light about it, like a bad lobster in\na dark cellar. It was not angry or ferocious, but looked at Scrooge as\nMarley used to look; with ghostly spectacles turned up on its ghostly\nforehead. The hair was curiously stirred, as if by breath or hot air;\nand, though the eyes were wide open, they were perfectly motionless.\nThat, and its livid colour, made it horrible; but its horror seemed to\nbe in spite of the face, and beyond its control, rather than a part of\nits own expression.\n\nAs Scrooge looked fixedly at this phenomenon, it was a knocker again.\n\nTo say that he was not startled, or that his blood was not conscious of\na terrible sensation to which it had been a stranger from infancy, would\nbe untrue. But he put his hand upon the key he had relinquished, turned\nit sturdily, walked in, and lighted his candle.\n\nHe _did_ pause, with a moment\'s irresolution, before he shut the door;\nand he _did_ look cautiously behind it first, as if he half expected to\nbe terrified with the sight of Marley\'s pigtail sticking out into the\nhall. But there was nothing on the back of the door, except the screws\nand nuts that held the knocker on, so he said, \'Pooh, pooh!\' and closed\nit with a bang.\n\nThe sound resounded through the house like thunder. Every room above,\nand every cask in the wine-merchant\'s cellars below, appeared to have a\nseparate peal of echoes of its own. Scrooge was not a man to be\nfrightened by echoes. He fastened the door, and walked across the hall,\nand up the stairs: slowly, too: trimming his candle as he went.\n\nYou may talk vaguely about driving a coach and six up a good old flight\nof stairs, or through a bad young Act of Parliament; but I mean to say\nyou might have got a hearse up that staircase, and taken it broadwise,\nwith the splinter-bar towards the wall, and the door towards the\nbalustrades: and done it easy. There was plenty of width for that, and\nroom to spare; which is perhaps the reason why Scrooge thought he saw a\nlocomotive hearse going on before him in the gloom. Half-a-dozen\ngas-lamps out of the street wouldn\'t have lighted the entry too well, so\nyou may suppose that it was pretty dark with Scrooge\'s dip.\n\nUp Scrooge went, not caring a button for that. Darkness is cheap, and\nScrooge liked it. But, before he shut his heavy door, he walked through\nhis rooms to see that all was right. He had just enough recollection of\nthe face to desire to do that.\n\nSitting-room, bedroom, lumber-room. All as they should be. Nobody under\nthe table, nobody under the sofa; a small fire in the grate; spoon and\nbasin ready; and the little saucepan of gruel (Scrooge had a cold in his\nhead) upon the hob. Nobody under the bed; nobody in the closet; nobody\nin his dressing-gown, which was hanging up in a suspicious attitude\nagainst the wall. Lumber-room as usual. Old fire-guard, old shoes, two\nfish baskets, washing-stand on three legs, and a poker.\n\n[Illustration: _Nobody under the bed; nobody in the closet; nobody in\nhis dressing-gown, which was hanging up in a suspicious attitude against\nthe wall_]\n\nQuite satisfied, he closed his door, and locked himself in; double\nlocked himself in, which was not his custom. Thus secured against\nsurprise, he took off his cravat; put on his dressing-gown and slippers,\nand his nightcap; and sat down before the fire to take his gruel.\n\nIt was a very low fire indeed; nothing on such a bitter night.

But I am sure I have always thought of Christmas-time, when\nit has come round--apart from the veneration due to its sacred name and\norigin, if anything belonging to it can be apart from that--as a good\ntime; a kind, forgiving, charitable, pleasant time; the only time I know\nof, in the long calendar of the year, when men and women seem by one\nconsent to open their shut-up hearts freely, and to think of people\nbelow them as if they really were fellow-passengers to the grave, and\nnot another race of creatures bound on other journeys. And therefore,\nuncle, though it has never put a scrap of gold or silver in my pocket, I\nbelieve that it _has_ done me good and _will_ do me good; and I say, God\nbless it!\'\n\nThe clerk in the tank involuntarily applauded. Becoming immediately\nsensible of the impropriety, he poked the fire, and extinguished the\nlast frail spark for ever.\n\n\'Let me hear another sound from _you_,\' said Scrooge, \'and you\'ll keep\nyour Christmas by losing your situation! You\'re quite a powerful\nspeaker, sir,\' he added, turning to his nephew. \'I wonder you don\'t go\ninto Parliament.\'\n\n\'Don\'t be angry, uncle. Come! Dine with us to-morrow.\'\n\nScrooge said that he would see him----Yes, indeed he did. He went the\nwhole length of the expression, and said that he would see him in that\nextremity first.\n\n\'But why?\' cried Scrooge\'s nephew. \'Why?\'\n\n\'Why did you get married?\' said Scrooge.\n\n\'Because I fell in love.\'\n\n\'Because you fell in love!\' growled Scrooge, as if that were the only\none thing in the world more ridiculous than a merry Christmas. \'Good\nafternoon!\'\n\n\'Nay, uncle, but you never came to see me before that happened.

He\nstopped at the outer door to bestow the greetings of the season on the\nclerk, who, cold as he was, was warmer than Scrooge; for he returned\nthem cordially.\n\n\'There\'s another fellow,\' muttered Scrooge, who overheard him: \'my\nclerk, with fifteen shillings a week, and a wife and family, talking\nabout a merry Christmas. I\'ll retire to Bedlam.\'\n\nThis lunatic, in letting Scrooge\'s nephew out, had let two other people\nin.

Good afternoon, gentlemen!\'\n\nSeeing clearly that it would be useless to pursue their point, the\ngentlemen withdrew. Scrooge resumed his labours with an improved opinion\nof himself, and in a more facetious temper than was usual with him.\n\nMeanwhile the fog and darkness thickened so, that people ran about with\nflaring links, proffering their services to go before horses in\ncarriages, and conduct them on their way. The ancient tower of a church,\nwhose gruff old bell was always peeping slyly down at Scrooge out of a\nGothic window in the wall, became invisible, and struck the hours and\nquarters in the clouds, with tremulous vibrations afterwards, as if its\nteeth were chattering in its frozen head up there. The cold became\nintense. In the main street, at the corner of the court, some labourers\nwere repairing the gas-pipes, and had lighted a great fire in a brazier,\nround which a party of ragged men and boys were gathered: warming their\nhands and winking their eyes before the blaze in rapture. The water-plug\nbeing left in solitude, its overflowings suddenly congealed, and turned\nto misanthropic ice. The brightness of the shops, where holly sprigs and\nberries crackled in the lamp heat of the windows, made pale faces ruddy\nas they passed. Poulterers\' and grocers\' trades became a splendid joke:\na glorious pageant, with which it was next to impossible to believe that\nsuch dull principles as bargain and sale had anything to do. The Lord\nMayor, in the stronghold of the mighty Mansion House, gave orders to his\nfifty cooks and butlers to keep Christmas as a Lord Mayor\'s household\nshould; and even the little tailor, whom he had fined five shillings on\nthe previous Monday for being drunk and bloodthirsty in the streets,\nstirred up to-morrow\'s pudding in his garret, while his lean wife and\nthe baby sallied out to buy the beef.\n\nFoggier yet, and colder! Piercing, searching, biting cold. If the good\nSt. Dunstan had but nipped the Evil Spirit\'s nose with a touch of such\nweather as that, instead of using his familiar weapons, then indeed he\nwould have roared to lusty purpose.

Let it also be borne\nin mind that Scrooge had not bestowed one thought on Marley since his\nlast mention of his seven-years\'-dead partner that afternoon. And then\nlet any man explain to me, if he can, how it happened that Scrooge,\nhaving his key in the lock of the door, saw in the knocker, without its\nundergoing any intermediate process of change--not a knocker, but\nMarley\'s face.\n\nMarley\'s face. It was not in impenetrable shadow, as the other objects\nin the yard were, but had a dismal light about it, like a bad lobster in\na dark cellar. It was not angry or ferocious, but looked at Scrooge as\nMarley used to look; with ghostly spectacles turned up on its ghostly\nforehead. The hair was curiously stirred, as if by breath or hot air;\nand, though the eyes were wide open, they were perfectly motionless.\nThat, and its livid colour, made it horrible; but its horror seemed to\nbe in spite of the face, and beyond its control, rather than a part of\nits own expression.\n\nAs Scrooge looked fixedly at this phenomenon, it was a knocker again.\n\nTo say that he was not startled, or that his blood was not conscious of\na terrible sensation to which it had been a stranger from infancy, would\nbe untrue. But he put his hand upon the key he had relinquished, turned\nit sturdily, walked in, and lighted his candle.\n\nHe _did_ pause, with a moment\'s irresolution, before he shut the door;\nand he _did_ look cautiously behind it first, as if he half expected to\nbe terrified with the sight of Marley\'s pigtail sticking out into the\nhall. But there was nothing on the back of the door, except the screws\nand nuts that held the knocker on, so he said, \'Pooh, pooh!\' and closed\nit with a bang.\n\nThe sound resounded through the house like thunder. Every room above,\nand every cask in the wine-merchant\'s cellars below, appeared to have a\nseparate peal of echoes of its own. Scrooge was not a man to be\nfrightened by echoes. He fastened the door, and walked across the hall,\nand up the stairs: slowly, too: trimming his candle as he went.\n\nYou may talk vaguely about driving a coach and six up a good old flight\nof stairs, or through a bad young Act of Parliament; but I mean to say\nyou might have got a hearse up that staircase, and taken it broadwise,\nwith the splinter-bar towards the wall, and the door towards the\nbalustrades: and done it easy. There was plenty of width for that, and\nroom to spare; which is perhaps the reason why Scrooge thought he saw a\nlocomotive hearse going on before him in the gloom. Half-a-dozen\ngas-lamps out of the street wouldn\'t have lighted the entry too well, so\nyou may suppose that it was pretty dark with Scrooge\'s dip.\n\nUp Scrooge went, not caring a button for that. Darkness is cheap, and\nScrooge liked it. But, before he shut his heavy door, he walked through\nhis rooms to see that all was right. He had just enough recollection of\nthe face to desire to do that.\n\nSitting-room, bedroom, lumber-room. All as they should be. Nobody under\nthe table, nobody under the sofa; a small fire in the grate; spoon and\nbasin ready; and the little saucepan of gruel (Scrooge had a cold in his\nhead) upon the hob. Nobody under the bed; nobody in the closet; nobody\nin his dressing-gown, which was hanging up in a suspicious attitude\nagainst the wall. Lumber-room as usual. Old fire-guard, old shoes, two\nfish baskets, washing-stand on three legs, and a poker.\n\n[Illustration: _Nobody under the bed; nobody in the closet; nobody in\nhis dressing-gown, which was hanging up in a suspicious attitude against\nthe wall_]\n\nQuite satisfied, he closed his door, and locked himself in; double\nlocked himself in, which was not his custom.

You\nwill, therefore, permit me to repeat, emphatically, that Marley was as\ndead as a door-nail.\n\nScrooge knew he was dead? Of course he did. How could it be otherwise?\nScrooge and he were partners for I don\'t know how many years. Scrooge\nwas his sole executor, his sole administrator, his sole assign, his sole\nresiduary legatee, his sole friend, and sole mourner. And even Scrooge\nwas not so dreadfully cut up by the sad event but that he was an\nexcellent man of business on the very day of the funeral, and solemnised\nit with an undoubted bargain.\n\nThe mention of Marley\'s funeral brings me back to the point I started\nfrom. There is no doubt that Marley was dead. This must be distinctly\nunderstood, or nothing wonderful can come of the story I am going to\nrelate. If we were not perfectly convinced that Hamlet\'s father died\nbefore the play began, there would be nothing more remarkable in his\ntaking a stroll at night, in an easterly wind, upon his own ramparts,\nthan there would be in any other middle-aged gentleman rashly turning\nout after dark in a breezy spot--say St. Paul\'s Churchyard, for\ninstance--literally to astonish his son\'s weak mind.\n\nScrooge never painted out Old Marley\'s name. There it stood, years\nafterwards, above the warehouse door: Scrooge and Marley. The firm was\nknown as Scrooge and Marley. Sometimes people new to the business called\nScrooge Scrooge, and sometimes Marley, but he answered to both names. It\nwas all the same to him.\n\nOh! but he was a tight-fisted hand at the grindstone, Scrooge! a\nsqueezing, wrenching, grasping, scraping, clutching, covetous old\nsinner! Hard and sharp as flint, from which no steel had ever struck out\ngenerous fire; secret, and self-contained, and solitary as an oyster.\nThe cold within him froze his old features, nipped his pointed nose,\nshrivelled his cheek, stiffened his gait; made his eyes red, his thin\nlips blue; and spoke out shrewdly in his grating voice. A frosty rime\nwas on his head, and on his eyebrows, and his wiry chin. He carried his\nown low temperature always about with him; he iced his office in the\ndog-days, and didn\'t thaw it one degree at Christmas.\n\nExternal heat and cold had little influence on Scrooge. No warmth could\nwarm, no wintry weather chill him. No wind that blew was bitterer than\nhe, no falling snow was more intent upon its purpose, no pelting rain\nless open to entreaty. Foul weather didn\'t know where to have him. The\nheaviest rain, and snow, and hail, and sleet could boast of the\nadvantage over him in only one respect. They often \'came down\'\nhandsomely, and Scrooge never did.\n\nNobody ever stopped him in the street to say, with gladsome looks, \'My\ndear Scrooge, how are you? When will you come to see me?\' No beggars\nimplored him to bestow a trifle, no children asked him what it was\no\'clock, no man or woman ever once in all his life inquired the way to\nsuch and such a place, of Scrooge. Even the blind men\'s dogs appeared to\nknow him; and, when they saw him coming on, would tug their owners into\ndoorways and up courts; and then would wag their tails as though they\nsaid, \'No eye at all is better than an evil eye, dark master!\'\n\nBut what did Scrooge care? It was the very thing he liked. To edge his\nway along the crowded paths of life, warning all human sympathy to keep\nits distance, was what the knowing ones call \'nuts\' to Scrooge.\n\nOnce upon a time--of all the good days in the year, on Christmas\nEve--old Scrooge sat busy in his counting-house. It was cold, bleak,\nbiting weather; foggy withal; and he could hear the people in the court\noutside go wheezing up and down, beating their hands upon their breasts,\nand stamping their feet upon the pavement stones to warm them. The City\nclocks had only just gone three, but it was quite dark already--it had\nnot been light all day--and candles were flaring in the windows of\n```\n\n{"named_entities": ["Marley", "Scrooge", "Hamlet", "St. Paul\'s Churchyard", "Old Marley"]}\n'}]

Piercing, searching, biting cold. If the good\nSt. Dunstan had but nipped the Evil Spirit\'s nose with a touch of such\nweather as that, instead of using his familiar weapons, then indeed he\nwould have roared to lusty purpose. The owner of one scant young nose,\ngnawed and mumbled by the hungry cold as bones are gnawed by dogs,\nstooped down at Scrooge\'s keyhole to regale him with a Christmas carol;\nbut, at the first sound of\n\n  \'God bless you, merry gentleman,\n  May nothing you dismay!\'\n\nScrooge seized the ruler with such energy of action that the singer fled\nin terror, leaving the keyhole to the fog, and even more congenial\nfrost.\n\nAt length the hour of shutting up the counting-house arrived. With an\nill-will Scrooge dismounted from his stool, and tacitly admitted the\nfact to the expectant clerk in the tank, who instantly snuffed his\ncandle out, and put on his hat.\n\n\'You\'ll want all day to-morrow, I suppose?\' said Scrooge.\n\n\'If quite convenient, sir.\'\n\n\'It\'s not convenient,\' said Scrooge, \'and it\'s not fair. If I was to\nstop half-a-crown for it, you\'d think yourself ill used, I\'ll be bound?\'\n\nThe clerk smiled faintly.\n\n\'And yet,\' said Scrooge, \'you don\'t think _me_ ill used when I pay a\nday\'s wages for no work.\'\n\n[Illustration: _Bob Cratchit went down a slide on Cornhill, at the end\nof a lane of boys, twenty times, in honour of its being Christmas\nEve_]\n\nThe clerk observed that it was only once a year.\n\n\'A poor excuse for picking a man\'s pocket every twenty-fifth of\nDecember!\' said Scrooge, buttoning his greatcoat to the chin. \'But I\nsuppose you must have the whole day. Be here all the earlier next\nmorning.\'\n\nThe clerk promised that he would; and Scrooge walked out with a growl.\nThe office was closed in a twinkling, and the clerk, with the long ends\nof his white comforter dangling below his waist (for he boasted no\ngreatcoat), went down a slide on Cornhill, at the end of a lane of boys,\ntwenty times, in honour of its being Christmas Eve, and then ran home to\nCamden Town as hard as he could pelt, to play at blind man\'s-buff.\n\nScrooge took his melancholy dinner in his usual melancholy tavern; and\nhaving read all the newspapers, and beguiled the rest of the evening\nwith his banker\'s book, went home to bed. He lived in chambers which had\nonce belonged to his deceased partner. They were a gloomy suite of\nrooms, in a lowering pile of building up a yard, where it had so little\nbusiness to be, that one could scarcely help fancying it must have run\nthere when it was a young house, playing at hide-and-seek with other\nhouses, and have forgotten the way out again. It was old enough now, and\ndreary enough; for nobody lived in it but Scrooge, the other rooms\nbeing all let out as offices. The yard was so dark that even Scrooge,\nwho knew its every stone, was fain to grope with his hands. The fog and\nfrost so hung about the black old gateway of the house, that it seemed\nas if the Genius of the Weather sat in mournful meditation on the\nthreshold.\n\nNow, it is a fact that there was nothing at all particular about the\nknocker on the door, except that it was very large. It is also a fact\nthat Scrooge had seen it, night and morning, during his whole residence\nin that place; also that Scrooge had as little of what is called fancy\nabout him as any man in the City of London, even including--which is a\nbold word--the corporation, aldermen, and livery. Let it also be borne\nin mind that Scrooge had not bestowed one thought on Marley since his\nlast mention of his seven-years\'-dead partner that afternoon. And then\nlet any man explain to me, if he can, how it happened that Scrooge,\nhaving his key in the lock of the door, saw in the knocker, without its\nundergoing any intermediate process of change--not a knocker, but\nMarley\'s face\n```\n\n{"named_entities": ["Scrooge", "St. Dunstan", "Evil Spirit", "Christmas", "Bob Cratchit", "Cornhill", "Camden Town", "London", "Marley"]}\n'}]

It was cold, bleak,\nbiting weather; foggy withal; and he could hear the people in the court\noutside go wheezing up and down, beating their hands upon their breasts,\nand stamping their feet upon the pavement stones to warm them. The City\nclocks had only just gone three, but it was quite dark already--it had\nnot been light all day--and candles were flaring in the windows of the\nneighbouring offices, like ruddy smears upon the palpable brown air. The\nfog came pouring in at every chink and keyhole, and was so dense\nwithout, that, although the court was of the narrowest, the houses\nopposite were mere phantoms. To see the dingy cloud come drooping down,\nobscuring everything, one might have thought that nature lived hard by,\nand was brewing on a large scale.\n\nThe door of Scrooge\'s counting-house was open, that he might keep his\neye upon his clerk, who in a dismal little cell beyond, a sort of tank,\nwas copying letters. Scrooge had a very small fire, but the clerk\'s fire\nwas so very much smaller that it looked like one coal. But he couldn\'t\nreplenish it, for Scrooge kept the coal-box in his own room; and so\nsurely as the clerk came in with the shovel, the master predicted that\nit would be necessary for them to part. Wherefore the clerk put on his\nwhite comforter, and tried to warm himself at the candle; in which\neffort, not being a man of strong imagination, he failed.\n\n\'A merry Christmas, uncle! God save you!\' cried a cheerful voice. It was\nthe voice of Scrooge\'s nephew, who came upon him so quickly that this\nwas the first intimation he had of his approach.\n\n\'Bah!\' said Scrooge. \'Humbug!\'\n\nHe had so heated himself with rapid walking in the fog and frost, this\nnephew of Scrooge\'s, that he was all in a glow; his face was ruddy and\nhandsome; his eyes sparkled, and his breath smoked again.\n\n\'Christmas a humbug, uncle!\' said Scrooge\'s nephew. \'You don\'t mean\nthat, I am sure?\'\n\n\'I do,\' said Scrooge. \'Merry Christmas! What right have you to be merry?\nWhat reason have you to be merry? You\'re poor enough.\'\n\n\'Come, then,\' returned the nephew gaily. \'What right have you to be\ndismal? What reason have you to be morose? You\'re rich enough.\'\n\nScrooge, having no better answer ready on the spur of the moment, said,\n\'Bah!\' again; and followed it up with \'Humbug!\'\n\n\'Don\'t be cross, uncle!\' said the nephew.\n\n\'What else can I be,\' returned the uncle, \'when I live in such a world\nof fools as this? Merry Christmas! Out upon merry Christmas! What\'s\nChristmas-time to you but a time for paying bills without money; a time\nfor finding yourself a year older, and not an hour richer; a time for\nbalancing your books, and having every item in \'em through a round dozen\nof months presented dead against you? If I could work my will,\' said\nScrooge indignantly, \'every idiot who goes about with "Merry Christmas"\non his lips should be boiled with his own pudding, and buried with a\nstake of holly through his heart. He should!\'\n\n\'Uncle!\' pleaded the nephew.\n\n\'Nephew!\' returned the uncle sternly, \'keep Christmas in your own way,\nand let me keep it in mine.\'\n\n\'Keep it!\' repeated Scrooge\'s nephew. \'But you don\'t keep it.\'\n\n\'Let me leave it alone, then,\' said Scrooge. \'Much good may it do you!\nMuch good it has ever done you!\'\n\n\'There are many things from which I might have derived good, by which I\nhave not profited, I dare say,\' returned the nephew; \'Christmas among\nthe rest. But I am sure I have always thought of Christmas-time, when\nit has come round--apart from the veneration due to its sacred name and\norigin, if anything belonging to it can be apart from that--as a good\ntime; a kind, forgiving, charitable, pleasant time; the only time I know\nof, in the long calendar of the year, when men and women seem by one\nconsent to open their shut-up hearts freely, and to think of people\nbelow them as if they really were fellow-passengers to the grave,\n```\n\n{"named_entities": "[\\n    \\"Scrooge"}\n'}]

And Scrooge\'s name\nwas good upon \'Change for anything he chose to put his hand to. Old\nMarley was as dead as a door-nail.\n\nMind! I don\'t mean to say that I know of my own knowledge, what there is\nparticularly dead about a door-nail. I might have been inclined, myself,\nto regard a coffin-nail as the deadest piece of ironmongery in the\ntrade. But the wisdom of our ancestors is in the simile; and my\nunhallowed hands shall not disturb it, or the country\'s done for. You\nwill, therefore, permit me to repeat, emphatically, that Marley was as\ndead as a door-nail.\n\nScrooge knew he was dead? Of course he did.

You\nwill, therefore, permit me to repeat, emphatically, that Marley was as\ndead as a door-nail.\n\nScrooge knew he was dead? Of course he did. How could it be otherwise?\nScrooge and he were partners for I don\'t know how many years. Scrooge\nwas his sole executor, his sole administrator, his sole assign, his sole\nresiduary legatee, his sole friend, and sole mourner. And even Scrooge\nwas not so dreadfully cut up by the sad event but that he was an\nexcellent man of business on the very day of the funeral, and solemnised\nit with an undoubted bargain.\n\nThe mention of Marley\'s funeral brings me back to the point I started\nfrom. There is no doubt that Marley was dead. This must be distinctly\nunderstood, or nothing wonderful can come of the story I am going to\nrelate. If we were not perfectly convinced that Hamlet\'s father died\nbefore the play began, there would be nothing more remarkable in his\ntaking a stroll at night, in an easterly wind, upon his own ramparts,\nthan there would be in any other middle-aged gentleman rashly turning\nout after dark in a breezy spot--say St. Paul\'s Churchyard, for\ninstance--literally to astonish his son\'s weak mind.\n\nScrooge never painted out Old Marley\'s name. There it stood, years\nafterwards, above the warehouse door: Scrooge and Marley. The firm was\nknown as Scrooge and Marley. Sometimes people new to the business called\nScrooge Scrooge, and sometimes Marley, but he answered to both names. It\nwas all the same to him.\n\nOh! but he was a tight-fisted hand at the grindstone, Scrooge! a\nsqueezing, wrenching, grasping, scraping, clutching, covetous old\nsinner! Hard and sharp as flint, from which no steel had ever struck out\ngenerous fire; secret, and self-contained, and solitary as an oyster.\nThe cold within him froze his old features, nipped his pointed nose,\nshrivelled his cheek, stiffened his gait; made his eyes red, his thin\nlips blue; and spoke out shrewdly in his grating voice. A frosty rime\nwas on his head, and on his eyebrows, and his wiry chin. He carried his\nown low temperature always about with him; he iced his office in the\ndog-days, and didn\'t thaw it one degree at Christmas.\n\nExternal heat and cold had little influence on Scrooge. No warmth could\nwarm, no wintry weather chill him. No wind that blew was bitterer than\nhe, no falling snow was more intent upon its purpose, no pelting rain\nless open to entreaty. Foul weather didn\'t know where to have him. The\nheaviest rain, and snow, and hail, and sleet could boast of the\nadvantage over him in only one respect. They often \'came down\'\nhandsomely, and Scrooge never did.\n\nNobody ever stopped him in the street to say, with gladsome looks, \'My\ndear Scrooge, how are you? When will you come to see me?\' No beggars\nimplored him to bestow a trifle, no children asked him what it was\no\'clock, no man or woman ever once in all his life inquired the way to\nsuch and such a place, of Scrooge. Even the blind men\'s dogs appeared to\nknow him; and, when they saw him coming on, would tug their owners into\ndoorways and up courts; and then would wag their tails as though they\nsaid, \'No eye at all is better than an evil eye, dark master!\'\n\nBut what did Scrooge care? It was the very thing he liked. To edge his\nway along the crowded paths of life, warning all human sympathy to keep\nits distance, was what the knowing ones call \'nuts\' to Scrooge.\n\nOnce upon a time--of all the good days in the year, on Christmas\nEve--old Scrooge sat busy in his counting-house. It was cold, bleak,\nbiting weather; foggy withal; and he could hear the people in the court\noutside go wheezing up and down, beating their hands upon their breasts,\nand stamping their feet upon the pavement stones to warm them. The City\nclocks had only just gone three, but it was quite dark already--it had\nnot been light all day--and candles were flaring in the windows of\n```\n'}]

It was cold, bleak,\nbiting weather; foggy withal; and he could hear the people in the court\noutside go wheezing up and down, beating their hands upon their breasts,\nand stamping their feet upon the pavement stones to warm them. The City\nclocks had only just gone three, but it was quite dark already--it had\nnot been light all day--and candles were flaring in the windows of the\nneighbouring offices, like ruddy smears upon the palpable brown air. The\nfog came pouring in at every chink and keyhole, and was so dense\nwithout, that, although the court was of the narrowest, the houses\nopposite were mere phantoms. To see the dingy cloud come drooping down,\nobscuring everything, one might have thought that nature lived hard by,\nand was brewing on a large scale.\n\nThe door of Scrooge\'s counting-house was open, that he might keep his\neye upon his clerk, who in a dismal little cell beyond, a sort of tank,\nwas copying letters. Scrooge had a very small fire, but the clerk\'s fire\nwas so very much smaller that it looked like one coal. But he couldn\'t\nreplenish it, for Scrooge kept the coal-box in his own room; and so\nsurely as the clerk came in with the shovel, the master predicted that\nit would be necessary for them to part. Wherefore the clerk put on his\nwhite comforter, and tried to warm himself at the candle; in which\neffort, not being a man of strong imagination, he failed.\n\n\'A merry Christmas, uncle! God save you!\' cried a cheerful voice. It was\nthe voice of Scrooge\'s nephew, who came upon him so quickly that this\nwas the first intimation he had of his approach.\n\n\'Bah!\' said Scrooge. \'Humbug!\'\n\nHe had so heated himself with rapid walking in the fog and frost, this\nnephew of Scrooge\'s, that he was all in a glow; his face was ruddy and\nhandsome; his eyes sparkled, and his breath smoked again.\n\n\'Christmas a humbug, uncle!\' said Scrooge\'s nephew. \'You don\'t mean\nthat, I am sure?\'\n\n\'I do,\' said Scrooge. \'Merry Christmas! What right have you to be merry?\nWhat reason have you to be merry? You\'re poor enough.\'\n\n\'Come, then,\' returned the nephew gaily. \'What right have you to be\ndismal? What reason have you to be morose? You\'re rich enough.\'\n\nScrooge, having no better answer ready on the spur of the moment, said,\n\'Bah!\' again; and followed it up with \'Humbug!\'\n\n\'Don\'t be cross, uncle!\' said the nephew.\n\n\'What else can I be,\' returned the uncle, \'when I live in such a world\nof fools as this? Merry Christmas! Out upon merry Christmas! What\'s\nChristmas-time to you but a time for paying bills without money; a time\nfor finding yourself a year older, and not an hour richer; a time for\nbalancing your books, and having every item in \'em through a round dozen\nof months presented dead against you? If I could work my will,\' said\nScrooge indignantly, \'every idiot who goes about with "Merry Christmas"\non his lips should be boiled with his own pudding, and buried with a\nstake of holly through his heart. He should!\'\n\n\'Uncle!\' pleaded the nephew.\n\n\'Nephew!\' returned the uncle sternly, \'keep Christmas in your own way,\nand let me keep it in mine.\'\n\n\'Keep it!\' repeated Scrooge\'s nephew. \'But you don\'t keep it.\'\n\n\'Let me leave it alone, then,\' said Scrooge. \'Much good may it do you!\nMuch good it has ever done you!\'\n\n\'There are many things from which I might have derived good, by which I\nhave not profited, I dare say,\' returned the nephew; \'Christmas among\nthe rest. But I am sure I have always thought of Christmas-time, when\nit has come round--apart from the veneration due to its sacred name and\norigin, if anything belonging to it can be apart from that--as a good\ntime; a kind, forgiving, charitable, pleasant time; the only time I know\nof, in the long calendar of the year, when men and women seem by one\nconsent to open their shut-up hearts freely, and to think of people\nbelow them as if they really were fellow-passengers to the grave,\n```\n'}]

And therefore,\nuncle, though it has never put a scrap of gold or silver in my pocket, I\nbelieve that it _has_ done me good and _will_ do me good; and I say, God\nbless it!\'\n\nThe clerk in the tank involuntarily applauded. Becoming immediately\nsensible of the impropriety, he poked the fire, and extinguished the\nlast frail spark for ever.\n\n\'Let me hear another sound from _you_,\' said Scrooge, \'and you\'ll keep\nyour Christmas by losing your situation! You\'re quite a powerful\nspeaker, sir,\' he added, turning to his nephew. \'I wonder you don\'t go\ninto Parliament.\'\n\n\'Don\'t be angry, uncle. Come! Dine with us to-morrow.\'\n\nScrooge said that he would see him----Yes, indeed he did. He went the\nwhole length of the expression, and said that he would see him in that\nextremity first.\n\n\'But why?\' cried Scrooge\'s nephew. \'Why?\'\n\n\'Why did you get married?\' said Scrooge.\n\n\'Because I fell in love.\'\n\n\'Because you fell in love!\' growled Scrooge, as if that were the only\none thing in the world more ridiculous than a merry Christmas. \'Good\nafternoon!\'\n\n\'Nay, uncle, but you never came to see me before that happened. Why give\nit as a reason for not coming now?\'\n\n\'Good afternoon,\' said Scrooge.\n\n\'I want nothing from you; I ask nothing of you; why cannot we be\nfriends?\'\n\n\'Good afternoon!\' said Scrooge.\n\n\'I am sorry, with all my heart, to find you so resolute. We have never\nhad any quarrel to which I have been a party. But I have made the trial\nin homage to Christmas, and I\'ll keep my Christmas humour to the last.\nSo A Merry Christmas, uncle!\'\n\n\'Good afternoon,\' said Scrooge.\n\n\'And A Happy New Year!\'\n\n\'Good afternoon!\' said Scrooge.\n\nHis nephew left the room without an angry word, notwithstanding. He\nstopped at the outer door to bestow the greetings of the season on the\nclerk, who, cold as he was, was warmer than Scrooge; for he returned\nthem cordially.\n\n\'There\'s another fellow,\' muttered Scrooge, who overheard him: \'my\nclerk, with fifteen shillings a week, and a wife and family, talking\nabout a merry Christmas. I\'ll retire to Bedlam.\'\n\nThis lunatic, in letting Scrooge\'s nephew out, had let two other people\nin. They were portly gentlemen, pleasant to behold, and now stood, with\ntheir hats off, in Scrooge\'s office. They had books and papers in their\nhands, and bowed to him.\n\n\'Scrooge and Marley\'s, I believe,\' said one of the gentlemen, referring\nto his list. \'Have I the pleasure of addressing Mr. Scrooge, or Mr.\nMarley?\'\n\n\'Mr. Marley has been dead these seven years,\' Scrooge replied. \'He died\nseven years ago, this very night.\'\n\n\'We have no doubt his liberality is well represented by his surviving\npartner,\' said the gentleman, presenting his credentials.\n\n[Illustration: THEY WERE PORTLY GENTLEMEN, PLEASANT TO BEHOLD]\n\nIt certainly was; for they had been two kindred spirits. At the ominous\nword \'liberality\' Scrooge frowned, and shook his head, and handed the\ncredentials back.\n\n\'At this festive season of the year, Mr. Scrooge,\' said the gentleman,\ntaking up a pen, \'it is more than usually desirable that we should make\nsome slight provision for the poor and destitute, who suffer greatly at\nthe present time. Many thousands are in want of common necessaries;\nhundreds of thousands are in want of common comforts, sir.\'\n\n\'Are there no prisons?\' asked Scrooge.\n\n\'Plenty of prisons,\' said the gentleman, laying down the pen again.\n\n\'And the Union workhouses?\' demanded Scrooge. \'Are they still\n```\n'}]

I don\'t make merry myself at Christmas,\nand I can\'t afford to make idle people merry. I help to support the\nestablishments I have mentioned--they cost enough: and those who are\nbadly off must go there.\'\n\n\'Many can\'t go there; and many would rather die.\'\n\n\'If they would rather die,\' said Scrooge, \'they had better do it, and\ndecrease the surplus population. Besides--excuse me--I don\'t know that.\'\n\n\'But you might know it,\' observed the gentleman.\n\n\'It\'s not my business,\' Scrooge returned. \'It\'s enough for a man to\nunderstand his own business, and not to interfere with other people\'s.\nMine occupies me constantly. Good afternoon, gentlemen!\'\n\nSeeing clearly that it would be useless to pursue their point, the\ngentlemen withdrew. Scrooge resumed his labours with an improved opinion\nof himself, and in a more facetious temper than was usual with him.\n\nMeanwhile the fog and darkness thickened so, that people ran about with\nflaring links, proffering their services to go before horses in\ncarriages, and conduct them on their way. The ancient tower of a church,\nwhose gruff old bell was always peeping slyly down at Scrooge out of a\nGothic window in the wall, became invisible, and struck the hours and\nquarters in the clouds, with tremulous vibrations afterwards, as if its\nteeth were chattering in its frozen head up there. The cold became\nintense. In the main street, at the corner of the court, some labourers\nwere repairing the gas-pipes, and had lighted a great fire in a brazier,\nround which a party of ragged men and boys were gathered: warming their\nhands and winking their eyes before the blaze in rapture. The water-plug\nbeing left in solitude, its overflowings suddenly congealed, and turned\nto misanthropic ice. The brightness of the shops, where holly sprigs and\nberries crackled in the lamp heat of the windows, made pale faces ruddy\nas they passed. Poulterers\' and grocers\' trades became a splendid joke:\na glorious pageant, with which it was next to impossible to believe that\nsuch dull principles as bargain and sale had anything to do. The Lord\nMayor, in the stronghold of the mighty Mansion House, gave orders to his\nfifty cooks and butlers to keep Christmas as a Lord Mayor\'s household\nshould; and even the little tailor, whom he had fined five shillings on\nthe previous Monday for being drunk and bloodthirsty in the streets,\nstirred up to-morrow\'s pudding in his garret, while his lean wife and\nthe baby sallied out to buy the beef.\n\nFoggier yet, and colder!

With an\nill-will Scrooge dismounted from his stool, and tacitly admitted the\nfact to the expectant clerk in the tank, who instantly snuffed his\ncandle out, and put on his hat.\n\n\'You\'ll want all day to-morrow, I suppose?\' said Scrooge.\n\n\'If quite convenient, sir.\'\n\n\'It\'s not convenient,\' said Scrooge, \'and it\'s not fair.

Be here all the earlier next\nmorning.\'\n\nThe clerk promised that he would; and Scrooge walked out with a growl.\nThe office was closed in a twinkling, and the clerk, with the long ends\nof his white comforter dangling below his waist (for he boasted no\ngreatcoat), went down a slide on Cornhill, at the end of a lane of boys,\ntwenty times, in honour of its being Christmas Eve, and then ran home to\nCamden Town as hard as he could pelt, to play at blind man\'s-buff.\n\nScrooge took his melancholy dinner in his usual melancholy tavern; and\nhaving read all the newspapers, and beguiled the rest of the evening\nwith his banker\'s book, went home to bed. He lived in chambers which had\nonce belonged to his deceased partner. They were a gloomy suite of\nrooms, in a lowering pile of building up a yard, where it had so little\nbusiness to be, that one could scarcely help fancying it must have run\nthere when it was a young house, playing at hide-and-seek with other\nhouses, and have forgotten the way out again. It was old enough now, and\ndreary enough; for nobody lived in it but Scrooge, the other rooms\nbeing all let out as offices. The yard was so dark that even Scrooge,\nwho knew its every stone, was fain to grope with his hands. The fog and\nfrost so hung about the black old gateway of the house, that it seemed\nas if the Genius of the Weather sat in mournful meditation on the\nthreshold.\n\nNow, it is a fact that there was nothing at all particular about the\nknocker on the door, except that it was very large. It is also a fact\nthat Scrooge had seen it, night and morning, during his whole residence\nin that place; also that Scrooge had as little of what is called fancy\nabout him as any man in the City of London, even including--which is a\nbold word--the corporation, aldermen, and livery.

It was not in impenetrable shadow, as the other objects\nin the yard were, but had a dismal light about it, like a bad lobster in\na dark cellar. It was not angry or ferocious, but looked at Scrooge as\nMarley used to look; with ghostly spectacles turned up on its ghostly\nforehead. The hair was curiously stirred, as if by breath or hot air;\nand, though the eyes were wide open, they were perfectly motionless.\nThat, and its livid colour, made it horrible; but its horror seemed to\nbe in spite of the face, and beyond its control, rather than a part of\nits own expression.\n\nAs Scrooge looked fixedly at this phenomenon, it was a knocker again.\n\nTo say that he was not startled, or that his blood was not conscious of\na terrible sensation to which it had been a stranger from infancy, would\nbe untrue. But he put his hand upon the key he had relinquished, turned\nit sturdily, walked in, and lighted his candle.\n\nHe _did_ pause, with a moment\'s irresolution, before he shut the door;\nand he _did_ look cautiously behind it first, as if he half expected to\nbe terrified with the sight of Marley\'s pigtail sticking out into the\nhall. But there was nothing on the back of the door, except the screws\nand nuts that held the knocker on, so he said, \'Pooh, pooh!\' and closed\nit with a bang.\n\nThe sound resounded through the house like thunder. Every room above,\nand every cask in the wine-merchant\'s cellars below, appeared to have a\nseparate peal of echoes of its own. Scrooge was not a man to be\nfrightened by echoes. He fastened the door, and walked across the hall,\nand up the stairs: slowly, too: trimming his candle as he went.\n\nYou may talk vaguely about driving a coach and six up a good old flight\nof stairs, or through a bad young Act of Parliament; but I mean to say\nyou might have got a hearse up that staircase, and taken it broadwise,\nwith the splinter-bar towards the wall, and the door towards the\nbalustrades: and done it easy.

You\nwill, therefore, permit me to repeat, emphatically, that Marley was as\ndead as a door-nail.\n\nScrooge knew he was dead? Of course he did. How could it be otherwise?\nScrooge and he were partners for I don\'t know how many years. Scrooge\nwas his sole executor, his sole administrator, his sole assign, his sole\nresiduary legatee, his sole friend, and sole mourner. And even Scrooge\nwas not so dreadfully cut up by the sad event but that he was an\nexcellent man of business on the very day of the funeral, and solemnised\nit with an undoubted bargain.\n\nThe mention of Marley\'s funeral brings me back to the point I started\nfrom. There is no doubt that Marley was dead. This must be distinctly\nunderstood, or nothing wonderful can come of the story I am going to\nrelate. If we were not perfectly convinced that Hamlet\'s father died\nbefore the play began, there would be nothing more remarkable in his\ntaking a stroll at night, in an easterly wind, upon his own ramparts,\nthan there would be in any other middle-aged gentleman rashly turning\nout after dark in a breezy spot--say St. Paul\'s Churchyard, for\ninstance--literally to astonish his son\'s weak mind.\n\nScrooge never painted out Old Marley\'s name. There it stood, years\nafterwards, above the warehouse door: Scrooge and Marley. The firm was\nknown as Scrooge and Marley. Sometimes people new to the business called\nScrooge Scrooge, and sometimes Marley, but he answered to both names. It\nwas all the same to him.\n\nOh! but he was a tight-fisted hand at the grindstone, Scrooge! a\nsqueezing, wrenching, grasping, scraping, clutching, covetous old\nsinner! Hard and sharp as flint, from which no steel had ever struck out\ngenerous fire; secret, and self-contained, and solitary as an oyster.\nThe cold within him froze his old features, nipped his pointed nose,\nshrivelled his cheek, stiffened his gait; made his eyes red, his thin\nlips blue; and spoke out shrewdly in his grating voice. A frosty rime\nwas on his head, and on his eyebrows, and his wiry chin. He carried his\nown low temperature always about with him; he iced his office in the\ndog-days, and didn\'t thaw it one degree at Christmas.\n\nExternal heat and cold had little influence on Scrooge. No warmth could\nwarm, no wintry weather chill him. No wind that blew was bitterer than\nhe, no falling snow was more intent upon its purpose, no pelting rain\nless open to entreaty. Foul weather didn\'t know where to have him. The\nheaviest rain, and snow, and hail, and sleet could boast of the\nadvantage over him in only one respect. They often \'came down\'\nhandsomely, and Scrooge never did.\n\nNobody ever stopped him in the street to say, with gladsome looks, \'My\ndear Scrooge, how are you? When will you come to see me?\' No beggars\nimplored him to bestow a trifle, no children asked him what it was\no\'clock, no man or woman ever once in all his life inquired the way to\nsuch and such a place, of Scrooge. Even the blind men\'s dogs appeared to\nknow him; and, when they saw him coming on, would tug their owners into\ndoorways and up courts; and then would wag their tails as though they\nsaid, \'No eye at all is better than an evil eye, dark master!\'\n\nBut what did Scrooge care? It was the very thing he liked. To edge his\nway along the crowded paths of life, warning all human sympathy to keep\nits distance, was what the knowing ones call \'nuts\' to Scrooge.\n\nOnce upon a time--of all the good days in the year, on Christmas\nEve--old Scrooge sat busy in his counting-house. It was cold, bleak,\nbiting weather; foggy withal; and he could hear the people in the court\noutside go wheezing up and down, beating their hands upon their breasts,\nand stamping their feet upon the pavement stones to warm them. The City\nclocks had only just gone three, but it was quite dark already--it had\nnot been light all day--and candles were flaring in the windows of\n```\n\n{"named_entities": ["Marley", "Scrooge", "Hamlet", "St. Paul\'s Churchyard", "Old Marley", "Christmas Eve"]}\n'}]

Let it also be borne\nin mind that Scrooge had not bestowed one thought on Marley since his\nlast mention of his seven-years\'-dead partner that afternoon. And then\nlet any man explain to me, if he can, how it happened that Scrooge,\nhaving his key in the lock of the door, saw in the knocker, without its\nundergoing any intermediate process of change--not a knocker, but\nMarley\'s face.\n\nMarley\'s face. It was not in impenetrable shadow, as the other objects\nin the yard were, but had a dismal light about it, like a bad lobster in\na dark cellar. It was not angry or ferocious, but looked at Scrooge as\nMarley used to look; with ghostly spectacles turned up on its ghostly\nforehead. The hair was curiously stirred, as if by breath or hot air;\nand, though the eyes were wide open, they were perfectly motionless.\nThat, and its livid colour, made it horrible; but its horror seemed to\nbe in spite of the face, and beyond its control, rather than a part of\nits own expression.\n\nAs Scrooge looked fixedly at this phenomenon, it was a knocker again.\n\nTo say that he was not startled, or that his blood was not conscious of\na terrible sensation to which it had been a stranger from infancy, would\nbe untrue. But he put his hand upon the key he had relinquished, turned\nit sturdily, walked in, and lighted his candle.\n\nHe _did_ pause, with a moment\'s irresolution, before he shut the door;\nand he _did_ look cautiously behind it first, as if he half expected to\nbe terrified with the sight of Marley\'s pigtail sticking out into the\nhall. But there was nothing on the back of the door, except the screws\nand nuts that held the knocker on, so he said, \'Pooh, pooh!\' and closed\nit with a bang.\n\nThe sound resounded through the house like thunder. Every room above,\nand every cask in the wine-merchant\'s cellars below, appeared to have a\nseparate peal of echoes of its own. Scrooge was not a man to be\nfrightened by echoes. He fastened the door, and walked across the hall,\nand up the stairs: slowly, too: trimming his candle as he went.\n\nYou may talk vaguely about driving a coach and six up a good old flight\nof stairs, or through a bad young Act of Parliament; but I mean to say\nyou might have got a hearse up that staircase, and taken it broadwise,\nwith the splinter-bar towards the wall, and the door towards the\nbalustrades: and done it easy. There was plenty of width for that, and\nroom to spare; which is perhaps the reason why Scrooge thought he saw a\nlocomotive hearse going on before him in the gloom. Half-a-dozen\ngas-lamps out of the street wouldn\'t have lighted the entry too well, so\nyou may suppose that it was pretty dark with Scrooge\'s dip.\n\nUp Scrooge went, not caring a button for that. Darkness is cheap, and\nScrooge liked it. But, before he shut his heavy door, he walked through\nhis rooms to see that all was right. He had just enough recollection of\nthe face to desire to do that.\n\nSitting-room, bedroom, lumber-room. All as they should be. Nobody under\nthe table, nobody under the sofa; a small fire in the grate; spoon and\nbasin ready; and the little saucepan of gruel (Scrooge had a cold in his\nhead) upon the hob. Nobody under the bed; nobody in the closet; nobody\nin his dressing-gown, which was hanging up in a suspicious attitude\nagainst the wall. Lumber-room as usual. Old fire-guard, old shoes, two\nfish baskets, washing-stand on three legs, and a poker.\n\n[Illustration: _Nobody under the bed; nobody in the closet; nobody in\nhis dressing-gown, which was hanging up in a suspicious attitude against\nthe wall_]\n\nQuite satisfied, he closed his door, and locked himself in; double\nlocked himself in, which was not his custom.

I don\'t mean to say that I know of my own knowledge, what there is\nparticularly dead about a door-nail. I might have been inclined, myself,\nto regard a coffin-nail as the deadest piece of ironmongery in the\ntrade. But the wisdom of our ancestors is in the simile; and my\nunhallowed hands shall not disturb it, or the country\'s done for. You\nwill, therefore, permit me to repeat, emphatically, that Marley was as\ndead as a door-nail.\n\nScrooge knew he was dead? Of course he did. How could it be otherwise?\nScrooge and he were partners for I don\'t know how many years. Scrooge\nwas his sole executor, his sole administrator, his sole assign, his sole\nresiduary legatee, his sole friend, and sole mourner.

He lived in chambers which had\nonce belonged to his deceased partner. They were a gloomy suite of\nrooms, in a lowering pile of building up a yard, where it had so little\nbusiness to be, that one could scarcely help fancying it must have run\nthere when it was a young house, playing at hide-and-seek with other\nhouses, and have forgotten the way out again. It was old enough now, and\ndreary enough; for nobody lived in it but Scrooge, the other rooms\nbeing all let out as offices. The yard was so dark that even Scrooge,\nwho knew its every stone, was fain to grope with his hands. The fog and\nfrost so hung about the black old gateway of the house, that it seemed\nas if the Genius of the Weather sat in mournful meditation on the\nthreshold.\n\nNow, it is a fact that there was nothing at all particular about the\nknocker on the door, except that it was very large.

Let it also be borne\nin mind that Scrooge had not bestowed one thought on Marley since his\nlast mention of his seven-years\'-dead partner that afternoon. And then\nlet any man explain to me, if he can, how it happened that Scrooge,\nhaving his key in the lock of the door, saw in the knocker, without its\nundergoing any intermediate process of change--not a knocker, but\nMarley\'s face\n```\n\n{"named_entities": ["Monday", "St. Dunstan", "Evil Spirit", "Scrooge", "Christmas", "Bob Cratchit", "Cornhill", "Camden Town", "Genius of the Weather", "City of London", "Marley"]}\n'}]

The cold became\nintense. In the main street, at the corner of the court, some labourers\nwere repairing the gas-pipes, and had lighted a great fire in a brazier,\nround which a party of ragged men and boys were gathered: warming their\nhands and winking their eyes before the blaze in rapture. The water-plug\nbeing left in solitude, its overflowings suddenly congealed, and turned\nto misanthropic ice.

It was cold, bleak,\nbiting weather; foggy withal; and he could hear the people in the court\noutside go wheezing up and down, beating their hands upon their breasts,\nand stamping their feet upon the pavement stones to warm them. The City\nclocks had only just gone three, but it was quite dark already--it had\nnot been light all day--and candles were flaring in the windows of the\nneighbouring offices, like ruddy smears upon the palpable brown air. The\nfog came pouring in at every chink and keyhole, and was so dense\nwithout, that, although the court was of the narrowest, the houses\nopposite were mere phantoms. To see the dingy cloud come drooping down,\nobscuring everything, one might have thought that nature lived hard by,\nand was brewing on a large scale.\n\nThe door of Scrooge\'s counting-house was open, that he might keep his\neye upon his clerk, who in a dismal little cell beyond, a sort of tank,\nwas copying letters. Scrooge had a very small fire, but the clerk\'s fire\nwas so very much smaller that it looked like one coal. But he couldn\'t\nreplenish it, for Scrooge kept the coal-box in his own room; and so\nsurely as the clerk came in with the shovel, the master predicted that\nit would be necessary for them to part. Wherefore the clerk put on his\nwhite comforter, and tried to warm himself at the candle; in which\neffort, not being a man of strong imagination, he failed.\n\n\'A merry Christmas, uncle! God save you!\' cried a cheerful voice. It was\nthe voice of Scrooge\'s nephew, who came upon him so quickly that this\nwas the first intimation he had of his approach.\n\n\'Bah!\' said Scrooge. \'Humbug!\'\n\nHe had so heated himself with rapid walking in the fog and frost, this\nnephew of Scrooge\'s, that he was all in a glow; his face was ruddy and\nhandsome; his eyes sparkled, and his breath smoked again.\n\n\'Christmas a humbug, uncle!\' said Scrooge\'s nephew. \'You don\'t mean\nthat, I am sure?\'\n\n\'I do,\' said Scrooge. \'Merry Christmas! What right have you to be merry?\nWhat reason have you to be merry? You\'re poor enough.\'\n\n\'Come, then,\' returned the nephew gaily. \'What right have you to be\ndismal? What reason have you to be morose? You\'re rich enough.\'\n\nScrooge, having no better answer ready on the spur of the moment, said,\n\'Bah!\' again; and followed it up with \'Humbug!\'\n\n\'Don\'t be cross, uncle!\' said the nephew.\n\n\'What else can I be,\' returned the uncle, \'when I live in such a world\nof fools as this? Merry Christmas! Out upon merry Christmas! What\'s\nChristmas-time to you but a time for paying bills without money; a time\nfor finding yourself a year older, and not an hour richer; a time for\nbalancing your books, and having every item in \'em through a round dozen\nof months presented dead against you? If I could work my will,\' said\nScrooge indignantly, \'every idiot who goes about with "Merry Christmas"\non his lips should be boiled with his own pudding, and buried with a\nstake of holly through his heart. He should!\'\n\n\'Uncle!\' pleaded the nephew.\n\n\'Nephew!\' returned the uncle sternly, \'keep Christmas in your own way,\nand let me keep it in mine.\'\n\n\'Keep it!\' repeated Scrooge\'s nephew. \'But you don\'t keep it.\'\n\n\'Let me leave it alone, then,\' said Scrooge. \'Much good may it do you!\nMuch good it has ever done you!\'\n\n\'There are many things from which I might have derived good, by which I\nhave not profited, I dare say,\' returned the nephew; \'Christmas among\nthe rest. But I am sure I have always thought of Christmas-time, when\nit has come round--apart from the veneration due to its sacred name and\norigin, if anything belonging to it can be apart from that--as a good\ntime; a kind, forgiving, charitable, pleasant time; the only time I know\nof, in the long calendar of the year, when men and women seem by one\nconsent to open their shut-up hearts freely, and to think of people\nbelow them as if they really were fellow-passengers to the grave,\n```\n\n{"named_entities": "[\\n    \\"Scrooge"}\n'}]

You\nwill, therefore, permit me to repeat, emphatically, that Marley was as\ndead as a door-nail.\n\nScrooge knew he was dead? Of course he did. How could it be otherwise?\nScrooge and he were partners for I don\'t know how many years. Scrooge\nwas his sole executor, his sole administrator, his sole assign, his sole\nresiduary legatee, his sole friend, and sole mourner. And even Scrooge\nwas not so dreadfully cut up by the sad event but that he was an\nexcellent man of business on the very day of the funeral, and solemnised\nit with an undoubted bargain.\n\nThe mention of Marley\'s funeral brings me back to the point I started\nfrom. There is no doubt that Marley was dead. This must be distinctly\nunderstood, or nothing wonderful can come of the story I am going to\nrelate. If we were not perfectly convinced that Hamlet\'s father died\nbefore the play began, there would be nothing more remarkable in his\ntaking a stroll at night, in an easterly wind, upon his own ramparts,\nthan there would be in any other middle-aged gentleman rashly turning\nout after dark in a breezy spot--say St. Paul\'s Churchyard, for\ninstance--literally to astonish his son\'s weak mind.\n\nScrooge never painted out Old Marley\'s name. There it stood, years\nafterwards, above the warehouse door: Scrooge and Marley. The firm was\nknown as Scrooge and Marley. Sometimes people new to the business called\nScrooge Scrooge, and sometimes Marley, but he answered to both names. It\nwas all the same to him.\n\nOh! but he was a tight-fisted hand at the grindstone, Scrooge! a\nsqueezing, wrenching, grasping, scraping, clutching, covetous old\nsinner! Hard and sharp as flint, from which no steel had ever struck out\ngenerous fire; secret, and self-contained, and solitary as an oyster.\nThe cold within him froze his old features, nipped his pointed nose,\nshrivelled his cheek, stiffened his gait; made his eyes red, his thin\nlips blue; and spoke out shrewdly in his grating voice. A frosty rime\nwas on his head, and on his eyebrows, and his wiry chin. He carried his\nown low temperature always about with him; he iced his office in the\ndog-days, and didn\'t thaw it one degree at Christmas.\n\nExternal heat and cold had little influence on Scrooge. No warmth could\nwarm, no wintry weather chill him. No wind that blew was bitterer than\nhe, no falling snow was more intent upon its purpose, no pelting rain\nless open to entreaty. Foul weather didn\'t know where to have him. The\nheaviest rain, and snow, and hail, and sleet could boast of the\nadvantage over him in only one respect. They often \'came down\'\nhandsomely, and Scrooge never did.\n\nNobody ever stopped him in the street to say, with gladsome looks, \'My\ndear Scrooge, how are you? When will you come to see me?\' No beggars\nimplored him to bestow a trifle, no children asked him what it was\no\'clock, no man or woman ever once in all his life inquired the way to\nsuch and such a place, of Scrooge. Even the blind men\'s dogs appeared to\nknow him; and, when they saw him coming on, would tug their owners into\ndoorways and up courts; and then would wag their tails as though they\nsaid, \'No eye at all is better than an evil eye, dark master!\'\n\nBut what did Scrooge care? It was the very thing he liked. To edge his\nway along the crowded paths of life, warning all human sympathy to keep\nits distance, was what the knowing ones call \'nuts\' to Scrooge.\n\nOnce upon a time--of all the good days in the year, on Christmas\nEve--old Scrooge sat busy in his counting-house. It was cold, bleak,\nbiting weather; foggy withal; and he could hear the people in the court\noutside go wheezing up and down, beating their hands upon their breasts,\nand stamping their feet upon the pavement stones to warm them.

It was cold, bleak,\nbiting weather; foggy withal; and he could hear the people in the court\noutside go wheezing up and down, beating their hands upon their breasts,\nand stamping their feet upon the pavement stones to warm them. The City\nclocks had only just gone three, but it was quite dark already--it had\nnot been light all day--and candles were flaring in the windows of the\nneighbouring offices, like ruddy smears upon the palpable brown air. The\nfog came pouring in at every chink and keyhole, and was so dense\nwithout, that, although the court was of the narrowest, the houses\nopposite were mere phantoms. To see the dingy cloud come drooping down,\nobscuring everything, one might have thought that nature lived hard by,\nand was brewing on a large scale.\n\nThe door of Scrooge\'s counting-house was open, that he might keep his\neye upon his clerk, who in a dismal little cell beyond, a sort of tank,\nwas copying letters. Scrooge had a very small fire, but the clerk\'s fire\nwas so very much smaller that it looked like one coal. But he couldn\'t\nreplenish it, for Scrooge kept the coal-box in his own room; and so\nsurely as the clerk came in with the shovel, the master predicted that\nit would be necessary for them to part. Wherefore the clerk put on his\nwhite comforter, and tried to warm himself at the candle; in which\neffort, not being a man of strong imagination, he failed.\n\n\'A merry Christmas, uncle! God save you!\' cried a cheerful voice. It was\nthe voice of Scrooge\'s nephew, who came upon him so quickly that this\nwas the first intimation he had of his approach.\n\n\'Bah!\' said Scrooge. \'Humbug!\'\n\nHe had so heated himself with rapid walking in the fog and frost, this\nnephew of Scrooge\'s, that he was all in a glow; his face was ruddy and\nhandsome; his eyes sparkled, and his breath smoked again.\n\n\'Christmas a humbug, uncle!\' said Scrooge\'s nephew. \'You don\'t mean\nthat, I am sure?\'\n\n\'I do,\' said Scrooge. \'Merry Christmas! What right have you to be merry?\nWhat reason have you to be merry? You\'re poor enough.\'\n\n\'Come, then,\' returned the nephew gaily. \'What right have you to be\ndismal? What reason have you to be morose? You\'re rich enough.\'\n\nScrooge, having no better answer ready on the spur of the moment, said,\n\'Bah!\' again; and followed it up with \'Humbug!\'\n\n\'Don\'t be cross, uncle!\' said the nephew.\n\n\'What else can I be,\' returned the uncle, \'when I live in such a world\nof fools as this? Merry Christmas! Out upon merry Christmas! What\'s\nChristmas-time to you but a time for paying bills without money; a time\nfor finding yourself a year older, and not an hour richer; a time for\nbalancing your books, and having every item in \'em through a round dozen\nof months presented dead against you? If I could work my will,\' said\nScrooge indignantly, \'every idiot who goes about with "Merry Christmas"\non his lips should be boiled with his own pudding, and buried with a\nstake of holly through his heart. He should!\'\n\n\'Uncle!\' pleaded the nephew.\n\n\'Nephew!\' returned the uncle sternly, \'keep Christmas in your own way,\nand let me keep it in mine.\'\n\n\'Keep it!\' repeated Scrooge\'s nephew. \'But you don\'t keep it.\'\n\n\'Let me leave it alone, then,\' said Scrooge. \'Much good may it do you!\nMuch good it has ever done you!\'\n\n\'There are many things from which I might have derived good, by which I\nhave not profited, I dare say,\' returned the nephew; \'Christmas among\nthe rest. But I am sure I have always thought of Christmas-time, when\nit has come round--apart from the veneration due to its sacred name and\norigin, if anything belonging to it can be apart from that--as a good\ntime; a kind, forgiving, charitable, pleasant time; the only time I know\nof, in the long calendar of the year, when men and women seem by one\nconsent to open their shut-up hearts freely, and to think of people\nbelow them as if they really were fellow-passengers to the grave,\n```\n'}]

Becoming immediately\nsensible of the impropriety, he poked the fire, and extinguished the\nlast frail spark for ever.\n\n\'Let me hear another sound from _you_,\' said Scrooge, \'and you\'ll keep\nyour Christmas by losing your situation! You\'re quite a powerful\nspeaker, sir,\' he added, turning to his nephew. \'I wonder you don\'t go\ninto Parliament.\'\n\n\'Don\'t be angry, uncle. Come! Dine with us to-morrow.\'\n\nScrooge said that he would see him----Yes, indeed he did. He went the\nwhole length of the expression, and said that he would see him in that\nextremity first.\n\n\'But why?\' cried Scrooge\'s nephew. \'Why?\'\n\n\'Why did you get married?\' said Scrooge.\n\n\'Because I fell in love.\'\n\n\'Because you fell in love!\' growled Scrooge, as if that were the only\none thing in the world more ridiculous than a merry Christmas. \'Good\nafternoon!\'\n\n\'Nay, uncle, but you never came to see me before that happened. Why give\nit as a reason for not coming now?\'\n\n\'Good afternoon,\' said Scrooge.\n\n\'I want nothing from you; I ask nothing of you; why cannot we be\nfriends?\'\n\n\'Good afternoon!\' said Scrooge.\n\n\'I am sorry, with all my heart, to find you so resolute. We have never\nhad any quarrel to which I have been a party. But I have made the trial\nin homage to Christmas, and I\'ll keep my Christmas humour to the last.\nSo A Merry Christmas, uncle!\'\n\n\'Good afternoon,\' said Scrooge.\n\n\'And A Happy New Year!\'\n\n\'Good afternoon!\' said Scrooge.\n\nHis nephew left the room without an angry word, notwithstanding. He\nstopped at the outer door to bestow the greetings of the season on the\nclerk, who, cold as he was, was warmer than Scrooge; for he returned\nthem cordially.\n\n\'There\'s another fellow,\' muttered Scrooge, who overheard him: \'my\nclerk, with fifteen shillings a week, and a wife and family, talking\nabout a merry Christmas. I\'ll retire to Bedlam.\'\n\nThis lunatic, in letting Scrooge\'s nephew out, had let two other people\nin. They were portly gentlemen, pleasant to behold, and now stood, with\ntheir hats off, in Scrooge\'s office. They had books and papers in their\nhands, and bowed to him.\n\n\'Scrooge and Marley\'s, I believe,\' said one of the gentlemen, referring\nto his list. \'Have I the pleasure of addressing Mr. Scrooge, or Mr.\nMarley?\'\n\n\'Mr. Marley has been dead these seven years,\' Scrooge replied. \'He died\nseven years ago, this very night.\'\n\n\'We have no doubt his liberality is well represented by his surviving\npartner,\' said the gentleman, presenting his credentials.\n\n[Illustration: THEY WERE PORTLY GENTLEMEN, PLEASANT TO BEHOLD]\n\nIt certainly was; for they had been two kindred spirits. At the ominous\nword \'liberality\' Scrooge frowned, and shook his head, and handed the\ncredentials back.\n\n\'At this festive season of the year, Mr. Scrooge,\' said the gentleman,\ntaking up a pen, \'it is more than usually desirable that we should make\nsome slight provision for the poor and destitute, who suffer greatly at\nthe present time.

Good afternoon, gentlemen!\'\n\nSeeing clearly that it would be useless to pursue their point, the\ngentlemen withdrew. Scrooge resumed his labours with an improved opinion\nof himself, and in a more facetious temper than was usual with him.\n\nMeanwhile the fog and darkness thickened so, that people ran about with\nflaring links, proffering their services to go before horses in\ncarriages, and conduct them on their way. The ancient tower of a church,\nwhose gruff old bell was always peeping slyly down at Scrooge out of a\nGothic window in the wall, became invisible, and struck the hours and\nquarters in the clouds, with tremulous vibrations afterwards, as if its\nteeth were chattering in its frozen head up there. The cold became\nintense. In the main street, at the corner of the court, some labourers\nwere repairing the gas-pipes, and had lighted a great fire in a brazier,\nround which a party of ragged men and boys were gathered: warming their\nhands and winking their eyes before the blaze in rapture. The water-plug\nbeing left in solitude, its overflowings suddenly congealed, and turned\nto misanthropic ice. The brightness of the shops, where holly sprigs and\nberries crackled in the lamp heat of the windows, made pale faces ruddy\nas they passed. Poulterers\' and grocers\' trades became a splendid joke:\na glorious pageant, with which it was next to impossible to believe that\nsuch dull principles as bargain and sale had anything to do. The Lord\nMayor, in the stronghold of the mighty Mansion House, gave orders to his\nfifty cooks and butlers to keep Christmas as a Lord Mayor\'s household\nshould; and even the little tailor, whom he had fined five shillings on\nthe previous Monday for being drunk and bloodthirsty in the streets,\nstirred up to-morrow\'s pudding in his garret, while his lean wife and\nthe baby sallied out to buy the beef.\n\nFoggier yet, and colder!

Be here all the earlier next\nmorning.\'\n\nThe clerk promised that he would; and Scrooge walked out with a growl.\nThe office was closed in a twinkling, and the clerk, with the long ends\nof his white comforter dangling below his waist (for he boasted no\ngreatcoat), went down a slide on Cornhill, at the end of a lane of boys,\ntwenty times, in honour of its being Christmas Eve, and then ran home to\nCamden Town as hard as he could pelt, to play at blind man\'s-buff.\n\nScrooge took his melancholy dinner in his usual melancholy tavern; and\nhaving read all the newspapers, and beguiled the rest of the evening\nwith his banker\'s book, went home to bed. He lived in chambers which had\nonce belonged to his deceased partner. They were a gloomy suite of\nrooms, in a lowering pile of building up a yard, where it had so little\nbusiness to be, that one could scarcely help fancying it must have run\nthere when it was a young house, playing at hide-and-seek with other\nhouses, and have forgotten the way out again. It was old enough now, and\ndreary enough; for nobody lived in it but Scrooge, the other rooms\nbeing all let out as offices. The yard was so dark that even Scrooge,\nwho knew its every stone, was fain to grope with his hands. The fog and\nfrost so hung about the black old gateway of the house, that it seemed\nas if the Genius of the Weather sat in mournful meditation on the\nthreshold.\n\nNow, it is a fact that there was nothing at all particular about the\nknocker on the door, except that it was very large. It is also a fact\nthat Scrooge had seen it, night and morning, during his whole residence\nin that place; also that Scrooge had as little of what is called fancy\nabout him as any man in the City of London, even including--which is a\nbold word--the corporation, aldermen, and livery. Let it also be borne\nin mind that Scrooge had not bestowed one thought on Marley since his\nlast mention of his seven-years\'-dead partner that afternoon. And then\nlet any man explain to me, if he can, how it happened that Scrooge,\nhaving his key in the lock of the door, saw in the knocker, without its\nundergoing any intermediate process of change--not a knocker, but\nMarley\'s face\n```\n'}]

It was not in impenetrable shadow, as the other objects\nin the yard were, but had a dismal light about it, like a bad lobster in\na dark cellar. It was not angry or ferocious, but looked at Scrooge as\nMarley used to look; with ghostly spectacles turned up on its ghostly\nforehead. The hair was curiously stirred, as if by breath or hot air;\nand, though the eyes were wide open, they were perfectly motionless.\nThat, and its livid colour, made it horrible; but its horror seemed to\nbe in spite of the face, and beyond its control, rather than a part of\nits own expression.\n\nAs Scrooge looked fixedly at this phenomenon, it was a knocker again.\n\nTo say that he was not startled, or that his blood was not conscious of\na terrible sensation to which it had been a stranger from infancy, would\nbe untrue. But he put his hand upon the key he had relinquished, turned\nit sturdily, walked in, and lighted his candle.\n\nHe _did_ pause, with a moment\'s irresolution, before he shut the door;\nand he _did_ look cautiously behind it first, as if he half expected to\nbe terrified with the sight of Marley\'s pigtail sticking out into the\nhall. But there was nothing on the back of the door, except the screws\nand nuts that held the knocker on, so he said, \'Pooh, pooh!\' and closed\nit with a bang.\n\nThe sound resounded through the house like thunder. Every room above,\nand every cask in the wine-merchant\'s cellars below, appeared to have a\nseparate peal of echoes of its own. Scrooge was not a man to be\nfrightened by echoes. He fastened the door, and walked across the hall,\nand up the stairs: slowly, too: trimming his candle as he went.\n\nYou may talk vaguely about driving a coach and six up a good old flight\nof stairs, or through a bad young Act of Parliament; but I mean to say\nyou might have got a hearse up that staircase, and taken it broadwise,\nwith the splinter-bar towards the wall, and the door towards the\nbalustrades: and done it easy. There was plenty of width for that, and\nroom to spare; which is perhaps the reason why Scrooge thought he saw a\nlocomotive hearse going on before him in the gloom. Half-a-dozen\ngas-lamps out of the street wouldn\'t have lighted the entry too well, so\nyou may suppose that it was pretty dark with Scrooge\'s dip.\n\nUp Scrooge went, not caring a button for that. Darkness is cheap, and\nScrooge liked it. But, before he shut his heavy door, he walked through\nhis rooms to see that all was right. He had just enough recollection of\nthe face to desire to do that.\n\nSitting-room, bedroom, lumber-room. All as they should be. Nobody under\nthe table, nobody under the sofa; a small fire in the grate; spoon and\nbasin ready; and the little saucepan of gruel (Scrooge had a cold in his\nhead) upon the hob. Nobody under the bed; nobody in the closet; nobody\nin his dressing-gown, which was hanging up in a suspicious attitude\nagainst the wall. Lumber-room as usual. Old fire-guard, old shoes, two\nfish baskets, washing-stand on three legs, and a poker.\n\n[Illustration: _Nobody under the bed; nobody in the closet; nobody in\nhis dressing-gown, which was hanging up in a suspicious attitude against\nthe wall_]\n\nQuite satisfied, he closed his door, and locked himself in; double\nlocked himself in, which was not his custom.

Many thousands are in want of common necessaries;\nhundreds of thousands are in want of common comforts, sir.\'\n\n\'Are there no prisons?\' asked Scrooge.\n\n\'Plenty of prisons,\' said the gentleman, laying down the pen again.\n\n\'And the Union workhouses?\' demanded Scrooge. \'Are they still in\noperation?\'\n\n\'They are. Still,\' returned the gentleman, \'I wish I could say they were\nnot.\'\n\n\'The Treadmill and the Poor Law are in full vigour, then?\' said Scrooge.\n\n\'Both very busy, sir.\'\n\n\'Oh! I was afraid, from what you said at first, that something had\noccurred to stop them in their useful course,\' said Scrooge. \'I am very\nglad to hear it.\'\n\n\'Under the impression that they scarcely furnish Christian cheer of mind\nor body to the multitude,\' returned the gentleman, \'a few of us are\nendeavouring to raise a fund to buy the Poor some meat and drink, and\nmeans of warmth. We choose this time, because it is a time, of all\nothers, when Want is keenly felt, and Abundance rejoices. What shall I\nput you down for?\'\n\n\'Nothing!\' Scrooge replied.\n\n\'You wish to be anonymous?\'\n\n\'I wish to be left alone,\' said Scrooge. \'Since you ask me what I wish,\ngentlemen, that is my answer. I don\'t make merry myself at Christmas,\nand I can\'t afford to make idle people merry. I help to support the\nestablishments I have mentioned--they cost enough: and those who are\nbadly off must go there.\'\n\n\'Many can\'t go there; and many would rather die.\'\n\n\'If they would rather die,\' said Scrooge, \'they had better do it, and\ndecrease the surplus population. Besides--excuse me--I don\'t know that.\'\n\n\'But you might know it,\' observed the gentleman.\n\n\'It\'s not my business,\' Scrooge returned. \'It\'s enough for a man to\nunderstand his own business, and not to interfere with other people\'s.\nMine occupies me constantly. Good afternoon, gentlemen!\'\n\nSeeing clearly that it would be useless to pursue their point, the\ngentlemen withdrew. Scrooge resumed his labours with an improved opinion\nof himself, and in a more facetious temper than was usual with him.\n\nMeanwhile the fog and darkness thickened so, that people ran about with\nflaring links, proffering their services to go before horses in\ncarriages, and conduct them on their way. The ancient tower of a church,\nwhose gruff old bell was always peeping slyly down at Scrooge out of a\nGothic window in the wall, became invisible, and struck the hours and\nquarters in the clouds, with tremulous vibrations afterwards, as if its\nteeth were chattering in its frozen head up there. The cold became\nintense. In the main street, at the corner of the court, some labourers\nwere repairing the gas-pipes, and had lighted a great fire in a brazier,\nround which a party of ragged men and boys were gathered: warming their\nhands and winking their eyes before the blaze in rapture. The water-plug\nbeing left in solitude, its overflowings suddenly congealed, and turned\nto misanthropic ice. The brightness of the shops, where holly sprigs and\nberries crackled in the lamp heat of the windows, made pale faces ruddy\nas they passed. Poulterers\' and grocers\' trades became a splendid joke:\na glorious pageant, with which it was next to impossible to believe that\nsuch dull principles as bargain and sale had anything to do. The Lord\nMayor, in the stronghold of the mighty Mansion House, gave orders to his\nfifty cooks and butlers to keep Christmas as a Lord Mayor\'s household\nshould; and even the little tailor, whom he had fined five shillings on\nthe previous Monday for being drunk and bloodthirsty in the streets,\nstirred up to-morrow\'s pudding in his garret, while his lean wife and\nthe baby sallied out to buy the beef.\n\nFoggier yet, and colder! Piercing, searching, biting cold. If the good\nSt. Dunstan had but nipped the Evil Spirit\'s nose with a touch of such\nweather as that, instead of using his familiar weapons, then indeed he\nwould have roared to lusty purpose.

You\nwill, therefore, permit me to repeat, emphatically, that Marley was as\ndead as a door-nail.\n\nScrooge knew he was dead? Of course he did. How could it be otherwise?\nScrooge and he were partners for I don\'t know how many years. Scrooge\nwas his sole executor, his sole administrator, his sole assign, his sole\nresiduary legatee, his sole friend, and sole mourner. And even Scrooge\nwas not so dreadfully cut up by the sad event but that he was an\nexcellent man of business on the very day of the funeral, and solemnised\nit with an undoubted bargain.\n\nThe mention of Marley\'s funeral brings me back to the point I started\nfrom. There is no doubt that Marley was dead. This must be distinctly\nunderstood, or nothing wonderful can come of the story I am going to\nrelate. If we were not perfectly convinced that Hamlet\'s father died\nbefore the play began, there would be nothing more remarkable in his\ntaking a stroll at night, in an easterly wind, upon his own ramparts,\nthan there would be in any other middle-aged gentleman rashly turning\nout after dark in a breezy spot--say St. Paul\'s Churchyard, for\ninstance--literally to astonish his son\'s weak mind.\n\nScrooge never painted out Old Marley\'s name. There it stood, years\nafterwards, above the warehouse door: Scrooge and Marley. The firm was\nknown as Scrooge and Marley. Sometimes people new to the business called\nScrooge Scrooge, and sometimes Marley, but he answered to both names. It\nwas all the same to him.\n\nOh! but he was a tight-fisted hand at the grindstone, Scrooge! a\nsqueezing, wrenching, grasping, scraping, clutching, covetous old\nsinner! Hard and sharp as flint, from which no steel had ever struck out\ngenerous fire; secret, and self-contained, and solitary as an oyster.\nThe cold within him froze his old features, nipped his pointed nose,\nshrivelled his cheek, stiffened his gait; made his eyes red, his thin\nlips blue; and spoke out shrewdly in his grating voice. A frosty rime\nwas on his head, and on his eyebrows, and his wiry chin. He carried his\nown low temperature always about with him; he iced his office in the\ndog-days, and didn\'t thaw it one degree at Christmas.\n\nExternal heat and cold had little influence on Scrooge. No warmth could\nwarm, no wintry weather chill him. No wind that blew was bitterer than\nhe, no falling snow was more intent upon its purpose, no pelting rain\nless open to entreaty. Foul weather didn\'t know where to have him. The\nheaviest rain, and snow, and hail, and sleet could boast of the\nadvantage over him in only one respect. They often \'came down\'\nhandsomely, and Scrooge never did.\n\nNobody ever stopped him in the street to say, with gladsome looks, \'My\ndear Scrooge, how are you? When will you come to see me?\' No beggars\nimplored him to bestow a trifle, no children asked him what it was\no\'clock, no man or woman ever once in all his life inquired the way to\nsuch and such a place, of Scrooge. Even the blind men\'s dogs appeared to\nknow him; and, when they saw him coming on, would tug their owners into\ndoorways and up courts; and then would wag their tails as though they\nsaid, \'No eye at all is better than an evil eye, dark master!\'\n\nBut what did Scrooge care? It was the very thing he liked. To edge his\nway along the crowded paths of life, warning all human sympathy to keep\nits distance, was what the knowing ones call \'nuts\' to Scrooge.\n\nOnce upon a time--of all the good days in the year, on Christmas\nEve--old Scrooge sat busy in his counting-house. It was cold, bleak,\nbiting weather; foggy withal; and he could hear the people in the court\noutside go wheezing up and down, beating their hands upon their breasts,\nand stamping their feet upon the pavement stones to warm them. The City\nclocks had only just gone three, but it was quite dark already--it had\nnot been light all day--and candles were flaring in the windows of\n```\n\n{"named_entities": ["Marley", "Scrooge", "Hamlet", "St. Paul\'s Churchyard", "Old Marley"]}\n'}]

We have never\nhad any quarrel to which I have been a party. But I have made the trial\nin homage to Christmas, and I\'ll keep my Christmas humour to the last.\nSo A Merry Christmas, uncle!\'\n\n\'Good afternoon,\' said Scrooge.\n\n\'And A Happy New Year!\'\n\n\'Good afternoon!\' said Scrooge.\n\nHis nephew left the room without an angry word, notwithstanding. He\nstopped at the outer door to bestow the greetings of the season on the\nclerk, who, cold as he was, was warmer than Scrooge; for he returned\nthem cordially.\n\n\'There\'s another fellow,\' muttered Scrooge, who overheard him: \'my\nclerk, with fifteen shillings a week, and a wife and family, talking\nabout a merry Christmas. I\'ll retire to Bedlam.\'\n\nThis lunatic, in letting Scrooge\'s nephew out, had let two other people\nin. They were portly gentlemen, pleasant to behold, and now stood, with\ntheir hats off, in Scrooge\'s office. They had books and papers in their\nhands, and bowed to him.\n\n\'Scrooge and Marley\'s, I believe,\' said one of the gentlemen, referring\nto his list. \'Have I the pleasure of addressing Mr. Scrooge, or Mr.\nMarley?\'\n\n\'Mr. Marley has been dead these seven years,\' Scrooge replied. \'He died\nseven years ago, this very night.\'\n\n\'We have no doubt his liberality is well represented by his surviving\npartner,\' said the gentleman, presenting his credentials.\n\n[Illustration: THEY WERE PORTLY GENTLEMEN, PLEASANT TO BEHOLD]\n\nIt certainly was; for they had been two kindred spirits. At the ominous\nword \'liberality\' Scrooge frowned, and shook his head, and handed the\ncredentials back.\n\n\'At this festive season of the year, Mr. Scrooge,\' said the gentleman,\ntaking up a pen, \'it is more than usually desirable that we should make\nsome slight provision for the poor and destitute, who suffer greatly at\nthe present time. Many thousands are in want of common necessaries;\nhundreds of thousands are in want of common comforts, sir.\'\n\n\'Are there no prisons?\' asked Scrooge.\n\n\'Plenty of prisons,\' said the gentleman, laying down the pen again.\n\n\'And the Union workhouses?\' demanded Scrooge. \'Are they still\n```\n\n{"named_entities": ["Christmas", "Scrooge", "Parliament", "New Year", "Bedlam", "Marley"]}\n'}]

Piercing, searching, biting cold. If the good\nSt. Dunstan had but nipped the Evil Spirit\'s nose with a touch of such\nweather as that, instead of using his familiar weapons, then indeed he\nwould have roared to lusty purpose. The owner of one scant young nose,\ngnawed and mumbled by the hungry cold as bones are gnawed by dogs,\nstooped down at Scrooge\'s keyhole to regale him with a Christmas carol;\nbut, at the first sound of\n\n  \'God bless you, merry gentleman,\n  May nothing you dismay!\'\n\nScrooge seized the ruler with such energy of action that the singer fled\nin terror, leaving the keyhole to the fog, and even more congenial\nfrost.\n\nAt length the hour of shutting up the counting-house arrived. With an\nill-will Scrooge dismounted from his stool, and tacitly admitted the\nfact to the expectant clerk in the tank, who instantly snuffed his\ncandle out, and put on his hat.\n\n\'You\'ll want all day to-morrow, I suppose?\' said Scrooge.\n\n\'If quite convenient, sir.\'\n\n\'It\'s not convenient,\' said Scrooge, \'and it\'s not fair.

He lived in chambers which had\nonce belonged to his deceased partner. They were a gloomy suite of\nrooms, in a lowering pile of building up a yard, where it had so little\nbusiness to be, that one could scarcely help fancying it must have run\nthere when it was a young house, playing at hide-and-seek with other\nhouses, and have forgotten the way out again. It was old enough now, and\ndreary enough; for nobody lived in it but Scrooge, the other rooms\nbeing all let out as offices. The yard was so dark that even Scrooge,\nwho knew its every stone, was fain to grope with his hands. The fog and\nfrost so hung about the black old gateway of the house, that it seemed\nas if the Genius of the Weather sat in mournful meditation on the\nthreshold.\n\nNow, it is a fact that there was nothing at all particular about the\nknocker on the door, except that it was very large.

And then\nlet any man explain to me, if he can, how it happened that Scrooge,\nhaving his key in the lock of the door, saw in the knocker, without its\nundergoing any intermediate process of change--not a knocker, but\nMarley\'s face.\n\nMarley\'s face. It was not in impenetrable shadow, as the other objects\nin the yard were, but had a dismal light about it, like a bad lobster in\na dark cellar. It was not angry or ferocious, but looked at Scrooge as\nMarley used to look; with ghostly spectacles turned up on its ghostly\nforehead. The hair was curiously stirred, as if by breath or hot air;\nand, though the eyes were wide open, they were perfectly motionless.\nThat, and its livid colour, made it horrible; but its horror seemed to\nbe in spite of the face, and beyond its control, rather than a part of\nits own expression.\n\nAs Scrooge looked fixedly at this phenomenon, it was a knocker again.\n\nTo say that he was not startled, or that his blood was not conscious of\na terrible sensation to which it had been a stranger from infancy, would\nbe untrue. But he put his hand upon the key he had relinquished, turned\nit sturdily, walked in, and lighted his candle.\n\nHe _did_ pause, with a moment\'s irresolution, before he shut the door;\nand he _did_ look cautiously behind it first, as if he half expected to\nbe terrified with the sight of Marley\'s pigtail sticking out into the\nhall. But there was nothing on the back of the door, except the screws\nand nuts that held the knocker on, so he said, \'Pooh, pooh!\' and closed\nit with a bang.\n\nThe sound resounded through the house like thunder. Every room above,\nand every cask in the wine-merchant\'s cellars below, appeared to have a\nseparate peal of echoes of its own. Scrooge was not a man to be\nfrightened by echoes. He fastened the door, and walked across the hall,\nand up the stairs: slowly, too: trimming his candle as he went.\n\nYou may talk vaguely about driving a coach and six up a good old flight\nof stairs, or through a bad young Act of Parliament; but I mean to say\nyou might have got a hearse up that staircase, and taken it broadwise,\nwith the splinter-bar towards the wall, and the door towards the\nbalustrades: and done it easy. There was plenty of width for that, and\nroom to spare; which is perhaps the reason why Scrooge thought he saw a\nlocomotive hearse going on before him in the gloom. Half-a-dozen\ngas-lamps out of the street wouldn\'t have lighted the entry too well, so\nyou may suppose that it was pretty dark with Scrooge\'s dip.\n\nUp Scrooge went, not caring a button for that. Darkness is cheap, and\nScrooge liked it. But, before he shut his heavy door, he walked through\nhis rooms to see that all was right. He had just enough recollection of\nthe face to desire to do that.\n\nSitting-room, bedroom, lumber-room. All as they should be. Nobody under\nthe table, nobody under the sofa; a small fire in the grate; spoon and\nbasin ready; and the little saucepan of gruel (Scrooge had a cold in his\nhead) upon the hob. Nobody under the bed; nobody in the closet; nobody\nin his dressing-gown, which was hanging up in a suspicious attitude\nagainst the wall. Lumber-room as usual. Old fire-guard, old shoes, two\nfish baskets, washing-stand on three legs, and a poker.\n\n[Illustration: _Nobody under the bed; nobody in the closet; nobody in\nhis dressing-gown, which was hanging up in a suspicious attitude against\nthe wall_]\n\nQuite satisfied, he closed his door, and locked himself in; double\nlocked himself in, which was not his custom.

I don\'t mean to say that I know of my own knowledge, what there is\nparticularly dead about a door-nail. I might have been inclined, myself,\nto regard a coffin-nail as the deadest piece of ironmongery in the\ntrade. But the wisdom of our ancestors is in the simile; and my\nunhallowed hands shall not disturb it, or the country\'s done for. You\nwill, therefore, permit me to repeat, emphatically, that Marley was as\ndead as a door-nail.\n\nScrooge knew he was dead? Of course he did. How could it be otherwise?\nScrooge and he were partners for I don\'t know how many years. Scrooge\nwas his sole executor, his sole administrator, his sole assign, his sole\nresiduary legatee, his sole friend, and sole mourner.

It was cold, bleak,\nbiting weather; foggy withal; and he could hear the people in the court\noutside go wheezing up and down, beating their hands upon their breasts,\nand stamping their feet upon the pavement stones to warm them. The City\nclocks had only just gone three, but it was quite dark already--it had\nnot been light all day--and candles were flaring in the windows of the\nneighbouring offices, like ruddy smears upon the palpable brown air. The\nfog came pouring in at every chink and keyhole, and was so dense\nwithout, that, although the court was of the narrowest, the houses\nopposite were mere phantoms. To see the dingy cloud come drooping down,\nobscuring everything, one might have thought that nature lived hard by,\nand was brewing on a large scale.\n\nThe door of Scrooge\'s counting-house was open, that he might keep his\neye upon his clerk, who in a dismal little cell beyond, a sort of tank,\nwas copying letters. Scrooge had a very small fire, but the clerk\'s fire\nwas so very much smaller that it looked like one coal. But he couldn\'t\nreplenish it, for Scrooge kept the coal-box in his own room; and so\nsurely as the clerk came in with the shovel, the master predicted that\nit would be necessary for them to part. Wherefore the clerk put on his\nwhite comforter, and tried to warm himself at the candle; in which\neffort, not being a man of strong imagination, he failed.\n\n\'A merry Christmas, uncle! God save you!\' cried a cheerful voice. It was\nthe voice of Scrooge\'s nephew, who came upon him so quickly that this\nwas the first intimation he had of his approach.\n\n\'Bah!\' said Scrooge. \'Humbug!\'\n\nHe had so heated himself with rapid walking in the fog and frost, this\nnephew of Scrooge\'s, that he was all in a glow; his face was ruddy and\nhandsome; his eyes sparkled, and his breath smoked again.\n\n\'Christmas a humbug, uncle!\' said Scrooge\'s nephew. \'You don\'t mean\nthat, I am sure?\'\n\n\'I do,\' said Scrooge. \'Merry Christmas! What right have you to be merry?\nWhat reason have you to be merry? You\'re poor enough.\'\n\n\'Come, then,\' returned the nephew gaily. \'What right have you to be\ndismal? What reason have you to be morose? You\'re rich enough.\'\n\nScrooge, having no better answer ready on the spur of the moment, said,\n\'Bah!\' again; and followed it up with \'Humbug!\'\n\n\'Don\'t be cross, uncle!\' said the nephew.\n\n\'What else can I be,\' returned the uncle, \'when I live in such a world\nof fools as this? Merry Christmas! Out upon merry Christmas! What\'s\nChristmas-time to you but a time for paying bills without money; a time\nfor finding yourself a year older, and not an hour richer; a time for\nbalancing your books, and having every item in \'em through a round dozen\nof months presented dead against you? If I could work my will,\' said\nScrooge indignantly, \'every idiot who goes about with "Merry Christmas"\non his lips should be boiled with his own pudding, and buried with a\nstake of holly through his heart. He should!\'\n\n\'Uncle!\' pleaded the nephew.\n\n\'Nephew!\' returned the uncle sternly, \'keep Christmas in your own way,\nand let me keep it in mine.\'\n\n\'Keep it!\' repeated Scrooge\'s nephew. \'But you don\'t keep it.\'\n\n\'Let me leave it alone, then,\' said Scrooge. \'Much good may it do you!\nMuch good it has ever done you!\'\n\n\'There are many things from which I might have derived good, by which I\nhave not profited, I dare say,\' returned the nephew; \'Christmas among\nthe rest. But I am sure I have always thought of Christmas-time, when\nit has come round--apart from the veneration due to its sacred name and\norigin, if anything belonging to it can be apart from that--as a good\ntime; a kind, forgiving, charitable, pleasant time; the only time I know\nof, in the long calendar of the year, when men and women seem by one\nconsent to open their shut-up hearts freely, and to think of people\nbelow them as if they really were fellow-passengers to the grave,\n```\n\n{"named_entities": "[\\n    \\"Scrooge"}\n'}]
