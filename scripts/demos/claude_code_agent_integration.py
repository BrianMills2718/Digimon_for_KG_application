I need you to process a GraphRAG query on a corpus. Here's what I need:

**Query**: {query}
**Corpus Path**: {corpus_path}

Please perform the following steps:

1. **Analyze the corpus** at {corpus_path}
   - Use your file reading capabilities to understand the content
   - Identify key entities and relationships

2. **Build a knowledge representation**
   - Extract entities and their relationships
   - Create a structured representation (you can use JSON)

3. **Process the query**
   - Search for relevant entities
   - Find connected information through relationships
   - Gather supporting text evidence

4. **Synthesize an answer**
   - Combine the findings into a comprehensive answer
   - Include citations to specific parts of the corpus

Please execute these steps using your available tools (file reading, analysis, etc.) 
and provide both the answer and the reasoning process you followed.

4. Provide comprehensive answers with evidence

- File reading capabilities
- Pattern matching and search
- Ability to maintain context across queries
- Natural reasoning about relationships

Let's start. Please first give me an overview of what's in the corpus.
