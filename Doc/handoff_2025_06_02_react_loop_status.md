## DIGIMON ReACT Loop Implementation Handoff - 2025-06-02

**Prepared by:** Cascade
**Date:** 2025-06-02

### 1. Objective

Implement, debug, and validate a fully functional iterative ReACT (Reason-Act-Observe) execution loop within the DIGIMON pipeline's `PlanningAgent`. The goal is to enable the agent to perform multi-step reasoning, tool execution, and adaptive replanning to answer complex user queries.

### 2. Current Status

*   The core ReACT loop logic (`process_query_react` method in `Core/AgentBrain/agent_brain.py`) has been implemented.
*   A dedicated test script, `testing/test_react_with_existing_data.py`, has been created. This script prepares a fictional corpus, builds an Entity-Relationship (ER) graph, and constructs a Vector Database (VDB) before invoking the ReACT loop with test queries.
*   The `test_react_with_existing_data.py` script runs to completion, and the ReACT loop executes multiple iterations for each query, attempting to reason and plan.
*   The non-ReACT planning and execution pipeline (tested via `digimon_cli.py` with `Data/Physics_Small`) appears to be functioning correctly, successfully preparing data, building graphs/VDBs, performing searches, and generating answers. This indicates that the underlying tools and data flow are sound.

### 3. Key Achievements & Working Functionalities

*   **Iterative Loop:** The ReACT loop can iterate multiple times (currently up to a max of 10 iterations).
*   **Initial Plan Generation:** The loop can generate an initial natural language plan based on the user query.
*   **Reasoning Step:** The `_react_reason` method is functional, allowing the LLM to reason about the current state, history, and available resources to decide on the next action.
*   **State Management:** `react_state` (including `reasoning_history`, `corpus_name`, `available_resources`) is maintained across iterations.
*   **Non-Tool Step Identification:** The loop can identify steps that are not direct tool calls.
*   **Final Answer Generation:** The loop generates a final answer, either when it believes the query is resolved or when it hits the maximum iteration limit.

### 4. Observed Issues & Blockers (Primarily from `test_react_with_existing_data.py`)

1.  **Resource Detection in `GraphRAGContext`:** This is the most critical blocker. The `PlanningAgent` instance within the ReACT loop consistently fails to detect the pre-built ER graph and VDB. Logs show `Available resources: {'corpus_prepared': True, 'graphs': [], 'vdbs': []}` even after the test script explicitly builds these resources using the *same* `GraphRAGContext` instance. This forces the ReACT loop to attempt to rebuild resources or use less effective fallback strategies.
2.  **Step Translation to Tool Calls:** The `_translate_step_to_tool_call` method struggles to convert the LLM's natural language action steps into specific, executable tool calls with correct schemas. This results in many "Non-tool step identified" or "ReAct: Failed to translate step" log messages.
3.  **Lack of Actual Tool Execution:** Due to the step translation issues, very few (if any) actual GraphRAG tools (e.g., `Entity.VDBSearch`, `Relationship.OneHopNeighbors`) are being successfully invoked and executed *within* the ReACT loop. The loop often cycles through reasoning steps without making concrete progress via tool use.
4.  **LLM Prompts for Step Generation:** The LLM sometimes generates plans that include steps to build resources (like ER graphs) even when these resources *should* be available (if detection worked). This might be a consequence of the resource detection failure or could indicate a need for refinement in the prompts provided to the LLM during the reasoning phase, to make it more aware of already existing assets.

### 5. Recent Important Code Changes

*   **`Core/AgentBrain/agent_brain.py`:**
    *   Extensive development and refinement of `PlanningAgent.process_query_react`.
    *   Implementation and updates to `PlanningAgent._react_reason`.
    *   Adjustments to how `available_resources` are determined and passed to the LLM.
*   **`testing/test_react_with_existing_data.py`:**
    *   Created as a new test harness for the ReACT loop with existing data.
    *   Iteratively fixed issues with `BuildERGraphInputs` schema (added `target_dataset_name`).
    *   Corrected parameter passing for `build_er_graph` and `entity_vdb_build_tool` calls.

### 6. Next Steps

1.  **Fix Resource Registration/Detection (High Priority):**
    *   Investigate why `GraphRAGContext` doesn't reflect the registered graph and VDB instances within the `PlanningAgent`'s ReACT loop. Check if the context instance is being correctly shared or if there's an issue with the registration/retrieval logic in `GraphRAGContext` itself (e.g., `register_graph_instance`, `get_graph_instance`, `list_graphs`).
    *   Add detailed logging within `GraphRAGContext` methods to trace the lifecycle of graph/VDB registration and lookup during the `test_react_with_existing_data.py` run.
2.  **Improve Step Translation & Tool Execution:**
    *   Refine the prompts used in `_react_reason` to guide the LLM to generate more precise and directly executable tool steps, making full use of the `tool_catalog` and `tool_schemas`.
    *   Enhance `_translate_step_to_tool_call` to more robustly parse LLM-generated steps and map them to the available tools and their required input schemas. Consider if the LLM should be prompted to return a more structured JSON for the action step itself.
    *   Ensure the `tool_catalog` and `tool_schemas` provided to the LLM are accurate, complete, and in a format that the LLM can effectively use for planning tool-based actions.
3.  **Refine ReACT Loop Logic for Failed Translations/Non-Tool Steps:**
    *   Develop more sophisticated strategies for handling steps that cannot be translated into tool calls. Instead of just re-reasoning, consider if the agent can ask for clarification or attempt alternative, simpler tool-based approaches.
4.  **Test with Simpler, Direct Tool Queries:**
    *   Once resource detection is reliable, create test queries that are designed to be answerable by a single, straightforward tool call (e.g., a query that directly maps to `Entity.VDBSearch` or `Relationship.OneHopNeighbors`). This will help isolate issues in the tool execution part of the ReACT cycle.
5.  **Iterate on Prompts for Resource Awareness:**
    *   Ensure the prompt for the initial plan generation and subsequent reasoning steps clearly communicates the *actually available* resources to the LLM to prevent it from planning redundant build steps.
