2025-05-30: Verified diagnostic logging cleanup status:
- Core/Retriever/BaseRetriever.py: 
  - logger.critical line at start of _run_personalized_pagerank is not present
  - Diagnostic logs in _run_personalized_pagerank are already using logger.debug
- Core/Retriever/EntitiyRetriever.py: No logger.critical diagnostic line at start of _find_relevant_entities_by_ppr
- Core/AgentTools/entity_tools.py: No logger.critical diagnostic line before entity_retriever._find_relevant_entities_by_ppr

All requested diagnostic logging cleanup appears to have already been completed in a previous update.

2025-05-30: Fixed test_agent_orchestrator.py to pass main_config as config arg to GraphFactory.get_graph
- Only passes data_path, storage_type, and storage_instance as kwargs
- Now matches factory expectations and avoids attribute errors

2025-05-30: Fixed Core/Graph/GraphFactory.py get_graph to use config.graph.type
- Now compatible with orchestrator and Config/GraphConfig.py changes

2025-05-30: Added 'type' field to GraphConfig in Config/GraphConfig.py
- Now supports main_config.graph.type for orchestrator and test compatibility

2025-05-30: Switched to using GraphFactory class instance for graph instantiation in testing/test_agent_orchestrator.py
- Now imports GraphFactory class, instantiates it, and calls get_graph
- Fixes ImportError for GRAPH_FACTORY and matches actual project API

2025-05-30: Fixed graph instantiation in testing/test_agent_orchestrator.py
- Now uses GraphFactory.get_graph_instance instead of direct BaseGraph instantiation
- Removed BaseGraph import; added logs for graph type returned by factory

2025-05-30: Fixed Workspace and NameSpace instantiation in testing/test_agent_orchestrator.py
- Now uses correct arguments: Workspace(working_dir=..., exp_name=...) and NameSpace(workspace=..., namespace=...)
- Ensures compatibility with actual class definitions (see Core/Storage/NameSpace.py)

2025-05-30: Fixed artifact/data path usage in testing/test_agent_orchestrator.py
- Now uses main_config.working_dir instead of root_path_for_artifacts for all artifact/data paths
- Workspace and VDB paths updated accordingly
- Added storage_root_dir to resolved_configs in GraphRAGContext

2025-05-30: Fixed embedding provider import and usage in testing/test_agent_orchestrator.py
- Now imports get_rag_embedding directly and calls get_rag_embedding(config=main_config)

2025-05-30: Created AgentOrchestrator module
- Added Core/AgentOrchestrator/__init__.py
- Added Core/AgentOrchestrator/orchestrator.py with initial implementation
  - Basic tool registry system with Pydantic model support
  - Plan execution framework with proper input resolution
  - Support for dynamic input resolution from:
    - Previous step outputs (via ToolInputSource)
    - Plan inputs (via "plan_inputs.*" references)
    - Literal values
  - Comprehensive logging for debugging
  - Support for named outputs between steps
  - Pydantic model validation for tool inputs
