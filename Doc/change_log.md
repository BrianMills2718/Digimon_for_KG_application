## 2025-06-02 15:43 PST - Fictional Corpus Stress Test

- Modified `testing/test_fictional_corpus.py` to execute a series of six diverse queries against the "Zorathian Empire" corpus to stress-test the pipeline.
- The script now loops through queries related to the empire's downfall, societal structure, technology, key figures, the Crystal Plague, and external interactions.
- For each query, it logs the answer and retrieved context keys, with a basic check for grounding.
- Executed the updated test script.

## 2025-06-02 16:11 PST - Fixed Named Output Key Instructions

- Enhanced the planning prompt in `Core/AgentBrain/agent_brain.py` to make instructions about `named_output_key` usage more explicit and forceful
- Added CRITICAL rule section emphasizing:
  - MUST use alias when defined in source step's `named_outputs`
  - Only use original field name when no alias is defined
  - NEVER use original field name when alias exists
- Re-ran test script successfully - all 6 queries completed without errors
- This resolved the Pydantic validation errors caused by None inputs when LLM incorrectly used original field names instead of aliases

## 2025-06-02 16:22 PST - ReACT-Style Stress Testing

- Created `testing/test_react_style_queries.py` to stress test the pipeline with complex multi-part queries
- Designed 6 ReACT-style queries that would benefit from iterative reasoning:
  1. Crystal Plague origin and empire fall connection
  2. Technology comparison between Zorathians and Mystara
  3. Leadership succession analysis
  4. Xelandra-Zorathian relationship determination
  5. Timeline reconstruction of empire decline
  6. Aerophantis role investigation
- Test successfully executed all queries with proper plan generation
- Observed that current system generates full execution plans upfront rather than true ReACT iterative reasoning
- All queries completed without Pydantic validation errors, confirming the named_output_key fix is working
- Note: True ReACT would require step-by-step execution with observation-based reasoning

## 2025-06-02 15:29 PST - README Update

- Updated `README.md` to better reflect current agent capabilities:
  - Enhanced "Agent Brain" description to include its role in answer synthesis from multiple context sources (VDB, graph relationships, text chunks).
  - Added a point highlighting the agent's current end-to-end pipeline orchestration capabilities (corpus prep, ER graph, VDB, search, one-hop, text fetch, answer generation) and noted ongoing improvements.

## 2025-06-02

- **Fix (agent_brain.py)**: Corrected syntax error introduced in previous edit (unmatched `]` bracket).
- **Enhancement (agent_brain.py)**: Implemented robust dynamic extraction of VDB search results and explicit system prompt for final answer generation.
- **Fix (agent_brain.py)**: Updated `SYSTEM_TASK` prompt in `_get_system_task_prompt_for_planning` to use correct output field names and aliases for multi-step plans (e.g., `graph_id` from `graph.BuildERGraph` aliased to `g_id`, `vdb_reference_id` from `Entity.VDB.Build` aliased to `v_id`, `similar_entities` from `Entity.VDBSearch` aliased to `s_entities`). Ensured downstream steps correctly reference these aliases. This addresses orchestrator errors where output keys were not found.
- **Fix (agent_brain.py)**: Initialized `current_plan`, `orchestrator_step_outputs`, and `serializable_context_for_prompt` to `None` or empty dicts at the start of the `try` block in `process_query` to prevent `NameError` if plan generation or early execution steps fail.

2025-06-02: Enhanced test_agent_corpus_to_graph_pipeline.py with Better Instructions and Debugging - COMPLETED

- Included direct implementation examples of input and output mappings in the instructions
- Enhanced orchestrator logging to specifically warn about missing named_outputs in tool calls
- Provided explicit input mapping format for entity_ids in step 4 to reference step 3 outputs
- Added detailed explanation of why named_outputs are critical for pipeline success

2025-06-02: Corpus Preparation & PlanningAgent Prompt Fixes
- **Agent Planning Prompt:** Updated the PlanningAgent's LLM prompt to make corpus preparation (corpus.PrepareFromDirectory) a mandatory first step for any directory-based corpus query. The prompt now explicitly instructs the LLM to always include this step when a corpus path is provided.
- **Prompt Example:** The plan example now uses the correct parameter names for corpus.PrepareFromDirectory: `input_directory_path`, `output_directory_path`, and `target_corpus_name`, matching the tool's Pydantic contract. The example also demonstrates correct output aliasing for downstream steps.
- **Output Path Consistency:** Clarified in the prompt that the output_directory_path should match the ChunkFactory's expected location (e.g., `results/{corpus_name}`), ensuring that Corpus.json is found by downstream tools.
- **F-string Syntax Fix:** Refactored the agent prompt construction to avoid Python f-string nested brace errors by building the prompt in string parts and joining them, eliminating syntax errors during runtime.
- **Next Steps:** With these changes, the agent should now always generate plans that first prepare the corpus and then proceed to graph and VDB building, resolving the root cause of missing Corpus.json and graph build failures.

    - Literal values
  - Comprehensive logging for debugging
  - Support for named outputs between steps
  - Pydantic model validation for tool inputs

2025-05-31: Integrated and tested graph construction tools
- Registered all graph construction tools (build_er_graph, build_rk_graph, etc.) in the orchestrator (`Core/AgentOrchestrator/orchestrator.py`).
- Added tool descriptions and schemas to the PlanningAgent for agent planning (documented in `_get_tool_documentation_for_prompt`).
- Added an async test in `testing/test_planning_agent.py` to build an ERGraph for 'american_revolution_doc' using the agent system.
- The test can now be run via the conda digimon environment for end-to-end validation.
- Confirmed agent can plan and execute ERGraph construction, with output artifact and status returned.

[2025-05-30 05:06] Updated Core/GraphRAG.py:
- In build_and_persist_artifacts, replaced hardcoded force=True with force=self.config.graph.force for entities_vdb.build_index.
- Updated preceding logger.info to a conditional log statement based on self.config.graph.force, for clarity and accuracy.

[2025-05-30 05:34] Updated testing/test_single_tool_entity_vdb_search.py:
- Changed VDB existence check to look for default__vector_store.json instead of vector_index.faiss.
- Improved warnings to check for directory and file existence, and provide more helpful output for debugging VDB presence.

[2025-05-30 06:07] Updated Core/AgentSchema/context.py:
- Added imports for BaseGraph, BaseIndex, and BaseCommunity.
- Added new fields to GraphRAGContext: graph_instance (BaseGraph), entities_vdb_instance (BaseIndex), relations_vdb_instance (BaseIndex), and community_instance (BaseCommunity), enabling direct resource access for agent tools.

[2025-05-30 06:25] Implemented entity_ppr_tool in Core/AgentTools/entity_tools.py:
- Added full async implementation for entity_ppr_tool, using EntityRetriever and RetrieverConfig to perform Personalized PageRank (PPR) for entities in a graph, with robust config handling and output formatting.

[2025-05-30 06:36] Created testing/test_single_tool_entity_ppr.py:
- Added a standalone async test script for entity_ppr_tool. The script loads config, embedding provider, graph, and VDB, builds a GraphRAGContext, and runs the tool with example seed entities, logging results.

[2025-05-30 06:52] Updated Option/Config2.py:
- Made Config.default() robust: it now tries Option/Config2.example.yaml, then Option/Config2.yaml, and finally falls back to programmatic defaults for all required fields (llm, embedding, graph, chunk, retriever, query_config) to prevent ValidationError at import time.

[2025-05-30 06:58] Fixed circular import in Option/Config2.py:
- Moved `from Core.Common.Logger import logger` into the Config.default() method body to resolve ImportError due to circular dependency with Core.Common.Logger.

[2025-05-30 07:02] Fully broke circular import in Option/Config2.py:
- Removed all logger usage from Config.default() and replaced with print statements, so Option/Config2.py no longer imports Core.Common.Logger at all. This severs the import cycle with Core.Common.Logger.

[2025-05-30 07:06] Fixed import error in Core/AgentTools/entity_tools.py:
- Changed import to match typo in actual filename: from Core.Retriever.EntitiyRetriever import EntityRetriever (was EntityRetriever.py, actual file is EntitiyRetriever.py).

[2025-05-30 07:10] Fixed RetrieverConfig import path in Core/AgentTools/entity_tools.py:
- Changed from Core.Config.RetrieverConfig import RetrieverConfig to Config.RetrieverConfig import RetrieverConfig to match project structure.

[2025-05-30 07:14] Removed unused/incorrect IndexFactory import from testing/test_single_tool_entity_ppr.py:
- Commented out from Core.Index.IndexFactory import IndexFactory because IndexFactory does not exist and is not needed in this script.

[2025-05-30 07:17] Fixed RetrieverConfig import path in testing/test_single_tool_entity_ppr.py:
- Changed from Core.Config.RetrieverConfig import RetrieverConfig to Config.RetrieverConfig import RetrieverConfig to match project structure.

[2025-05-30 07:34] Fixed NetworkXStorage instantiation in testing/test_single_tool_entity_ppr.py:
- Removed old direct instantiation with config/namespace args.
- Updated to use async helper get_loaded_graph_instance with correct parameters, matching TestGraph construction logic and avoiding TypeError.

[2025-05-30 07:41] Updated get_loaded_graph_instance in testing/test_single_tool_entity_ppr.py:
- Now creates Workspace object and passes it to NameSpace for correct storage path resolution, aligning with project design.

[2025-05-30 07:44] Fixed async graph loading and Pydantic input error in testing/test_single_tool_entity_ppr.py:
- Awaited NetworkXStorage.load_graph(force=False) to ensure the graph is loaded and avoid RuntimeWarning.
- Added required graph_reference_id argument to EntityPPRInputs to resolve ValidationError.

[2025-05-30 07:50] Fixed graph file path logic for NetworkXStorage:
- Updated Core/Storage/NetworkXStorage.py: graphml_xml_file now joins directory from NameSpace.get_save_path() with self.name.
- Updated testing/test_single_tool_entity_ppr.py: explicitly sets _storage.name to "graph_storage_nx_data.graphml" to match actual file.

[2025-05-30 07:54] Replaced entity_ppr_tool placeholder with robust EntityRetriever-based implementation in Core/AgentTools/entity_tools.py:
- Now calls EntityRetriever._find_relevant_entities_by_ppr and returns real PPR results, handling config and context robustly.

[2025-05-30 10:06] Updated Core/Retriever/BaseRetriever.py:
- Added logger.critical("BaseRetriever: ENTERING _run_personalized_pagerank method NOW!") as the first line inside async def _run_personalized_pagerank, before any other code, for method entry diagnostics.

[2025-05-30 10:25] Enhanced diagnostic logging:
- Added logger.critical statement at the start of EntityRetriever._find_relevant_entities_by_ppr in Core/Retriever/EntitiyRetriever.py.
- Added logger.critical diagnostic statement before calling entity_retriever._find_relevant_entities_by_ppr in entity_ppr_tool in Core/AgentTools/entity_tools.py.

[2025-05-30 10:27] Bugfix: Decorator return in RetrieverFactory
- Modified register_retriever_method in Core/Retriever/RetrieverFactory.py so that the inner decorator(func) returns func, ensuring decorator chaining and registration work as expected.

[2025-05-30 10:44] Cleanup: Removed temporary diagnostic logging
- Core/Retriever/BaseRetriever.py: Removed logger.critical from _run_personalized_pagerank and reverted logger.error to logger.debug in the first diagnostic block.
- Core/Retriever/EntitiyRetriever.py: Removed logger.critical from _find_relevant_entities_by_ppr.
- Core/AgentTools/entity_tools.py: Removed the diagnostic logger.critical and associated block before calling entity_retriever._find_relevant_entities_by_ppr in entity_ppr_tool.

- Manually provided corrected `relationship_one_hop_neighbors_tool` code to USER after tool call failures. Integrated user's new detailed logging, retained previous fixes (param/attribute access, Pydantic models), and used user's robust graph instance check. Advised manual update, cache clearing, and re-test.

- Core/AgentTools/relationship_tools.py: Updated `relationship_one_hop_neighbors_tool` to access the NetworkX graph via `graph_instance._graph.graph` and adjusted conditional checks accordingly, as per user-provided code.

## Change Log (.model - for Cascade Agent)

### 2025-05-31
- **LiteLLMProvider config compatibility fix**
    - Added `self.temperature` and `self.max_token` to `LiteLLMProvider.__init__`, loading from config.
    - Added `self.max_tokens` as an alias to `self.max_token` for compatibility with agent_brain usage.
    - Set `litellm.drop_params = True` after importing litellm in LiteLLMProvider.py to automatically drop unsupported parameters (like temperature) for O-series models (e.g., o4-mini) and similar, improving compatibility with OpenAI endpoints.
    - Fixes attribute error during plan generation in PlanningAgent when using LiteLLMProvider.
- Replaced the `google_gemini_completion` function in `standalone_litellm_example.py` to:
    - Set both `GEMINI_API_KEY` and `GOOGLE_API_KEY` in the environment for Gemini calls.
    - Pass `api_key` directly to `litellm.completion`.
    - Restore original environment variables after execution.
    - Improves robustness and compatibility with LiteLLM Gemini provider and avoids side effects.
- Updated `LiteLLMProvider.py`:
    - `_achat_completion`, `_achat_completion_stream`, and `async_instructor_completion` now set and restore `GEMINI_API_KEY` and `GOOGLE_API_KEY` environment variables when using Gemini models.
    - Ensures robust Gemini API key handling for all async completions and instructor-based completions.
- **Fix & Validation: `Relationship.OneHopNeighbors` Tool Graph Access**
  - Confirmed that the `relationship_one_hop_neighbors_tool` in `Core/AgentTools/relationship_tools.py` is now functioning correctly within the multi-step orchestrator test plan (`testing/test_agent_orchestrator.py`).
  - The tool successfully accesses the NetworkX graph instance via `graph_instance._graph.graph` as intended.
  - Test logs (`test_orchestrator_log_3step.txt`) show the tool executing without Python errors and correctly returning an empty list of relationships when the input entity IDs were not found in the graph. This verifies the updated graph access mechanism and conditional checks are working as expected.
  - This resolves the primary objective of ensuring the tool's correct integration and behavior regarding graph data access.

- **Test Execution: `test_plan_003_vdb_then_one_hop.json`**
  - Successfully executed the command `python testing/test_agent_orchestrator.py --config Option/Config2.yaml --plan test_plans/test_plan_003_vdb_then_one_hop.json`.
  - Breakthrough: `/tmp/config_attrs_diag.txt` WAS created, confirming the diagnostic block in `test_agent_orchestrator.py` (after `main_config` import) executes and can access config attributes & perform file I/O. 
- However, `stderr` prints (even via captured reference) are still NOT visible in `run_command` output after `main_config`/Loguru init. This points to Loguru's `stderr` handling obscuring direct prints from `run_command`'s capture. 
- Log directory `/home/brian/digimon/default/Logs/` not found, despite `config_attrs_diag.txt` showing `working_dir=./results` and `exp_name=test`. Investigating actual path used by Logger.py.

2025-06-01: Test Script Fixes - COMPLETED
- Modified Files:
1. **testing/test_agent_corpus_to_graph_pipeline.py**
   - Fixed import for `LlamaIndexBaseEmbedding` type hint
   - Updated `build_er_graph_wrapper` to use correct type hint for `encoder_instance`
   - Fixed VDB building call to use correct parameter order: `build_index(data_source, force=True, meta_data_keys=[...])`
   - Updated `test_agent_corpus_to_graph_pipeline` function:
     - Fixed config loading to use `Config(config_path=str(config_path))` instead of `Config.default()`
     - Fixed LLM initialization to use `main_config.llm_config`
     - Fixed embedding initialization to use `main_config.embedding_config`
     - Fixed ChunkFactory initialization to use `main_config.chunk` instead of full config
   - Updated SYSTEM_TASK instructions:
     - Step 2: Changed named outputs to use explicit mapping: `{'graph_id_from_build': 'graph_id', 'status_from_build': 'status'}`
     - Step 3: Changed named outputs to use explicit mapping: `{'vdb_search_results_list': 'similar_entities'}`
     - Step 4: Updated input references to use new named output keys from previous steps
     - Step 4: Added named outputs mapping: `{'final_neighbor_info': 'one_hop_relationships'}`
   - Updated verification logging to check for outputs using correct step IDs and named output keys

### Key Changes Summary:
- Fixed all type hints and imports
- Corrected VDB build_index method call signature
- Updated config and component initialization
- Improved SYSTEM_TASK with explicit output naming mappings
- Enhanced verification logging for better debugging

2024-12-28 - Test Script Fixes

     - Fixed LLM initialization to use `main_config.llm`
     - Fixed embedding initialization to use `get_rag_embedding(config=main_config)`
     - Fixed ChunkFactory initialization to use full config object
     - Updated input directory to use `Data/MySampleTexts` which contains actual test documents
   - Updated SYSTEM_TASK instructions:
     - Step 2: Changed named outputs to use explicit mapping: `{'graph_id_from_build': 'graph_id', 'status_from_build': 'status'}`
     - Step 3: Changed named outputs to use explicit mapping: `{'vdb_search_results_list': 'similar_entities'}`
     - Step 4: Updated input references to use new named output keys from previous steps
     - Step 4: Added named outputs mapping: `{'final_neighbor_info': 'one_hop_relationships'}`
   - Updated verification logging to check for outputs using correct step IDs and named output keys

### Key Changes Summary:
- Fixed all type hints and imports
- Corrected VDB build_index method call signature
- Updated config and component initialization
- Improved SYSTEM_TASK with explicit output naming mappings
- Enhanced verification logging for better debugging
- Fixed input directory path to use existing test data

### Test Results:
- Test now runs successfully end-to-end
- Pipeline executes all 4 steps: corpus preparation, graph building, VDB search, and neighbor retrieval
- Need to investigate why VDB search returns empty results despite successful execution
- Updated SYSTEM_TASK to include proper named outputs mapping for corpus preparation step

2025-06-02: Fixed VDB Building Method Call in test_agent_corpus_to_graph_pipeline.py - COMPLETED
- Changed VDB building from incorrect `build_index_from_documents()` to correct `build_index(elements, meta_data, force=True)`
- Fixed parameters to match BaseIndex.build_index signature: elements (list of dicts) and meta_data (list of metadata keys)
- Used meta_data=["id", "content", "name"] to match entity document structure
- Successfully fixed VDB indexing and registration in shared context - VDB search now returns relevant entities
- VDB search step now returns 5 entities with similarity scores for "causes of the American Revolution" query
- Pipeline VDB functionality fully restored: corpus preparation → graph building → VDB building → VDB search all working

2025-06-02: Fixed Orchestrator Entity ID Extraction for Dictionary Results - COMPLETED
- Added handling for plain dictionary results from VDB search in AgentOrchestrator._resolve_single_input_source
- Now correctly extracts node_id from dict results, falling back to entity_name if node_id not present
- Fixed entity_ids parameter passing from VDB search step to one-hop neighbors step
- Entity IDs are now properly extracted (5 IDs) and passed to relationship tools

2025-06-02: Identified Graph Node ID Mismatch Issue - DISCOVERY
- Found root cause: ERGraph uses entity names as node IDs (e.g., "the american revolution")
- VDB returns UUID-style node_ids (e.g., "93de506c05bf0bc71fa29a19afdc190e") that don't exist in graph
- This mismatch explains why one-hop neighbors returns empty despite correct orchestrator fixes
- Need to either: (1) make VDB return entity names, or (2) update graph to use same UUIDs as VDB

2025-06-02: Fixed One-Hop Neighbors by Prioritizing Entity Names - COMPLETED
- Modified orchestrator to prioritize entity_name extraction over node_id for graph operations
- Since ERGraph uses entity names as node IDs, this ensures proper ID matching
- One-hop neighbors now successfully finds 6 relationships from 5 VDB search results
- Full pipeline now works end-to-end: corpus → graph → VDB → search → neighbors → answer generation
- Agent successfully generates meaningful answers using retrieved graph relationships

2025-06-02: Added Dynamic Custom Ontology Generation for ER Graph
- Created ontology_generator.py with generate_custom_ontology() function
- Modified ERGraph._build_graph() to automatically generate domain-specific ontologies from corpus content
- Enhanced _named_entity_recognition() to include entity type guidance from custom ontology
- Enhanced _openie_post_ner_extract() to include relationship type guidance from custom ontology
- Ontology is generated using LLM based on first few chunks of corpus for context
- Should fix "unknown_relationship" issue by providing domain-specific relationship types

2025-06-02: Fixed Dynamic Custom Ontology Generation and Edge Name Storage
- Found that relationships were being extracted correctly (e.g., "spanned", "occurred in") but not saved
- Issue: VDB build tool receives a fresh graph instance without the built nodes
- Root cause: Graph is built in one step but not persisted/shared properly with VDB build step
- The context.get_graph_instance() returns existing graph, but it appears empty
- Need to investigate graph persistence and sharing between agent tool executions
- Fixed enable_edge_name=false in graph config, causing relation_name to be ignored
- Updated test to include enable_edge_name=true in config_overrides
- Improved ontology_generator.py JSON parsing to handle various response formats
- Added debug logging to track ontology generation and relationship extraction
- Should now save meaningful relationship names instead of empty strings

2025-06-02: Fixed One-Hop Neighbors Tool to Return Actual Relationship Names
- Found that relationship_tools.py was looking for 'type' attribute on edges
- Changed edge_attr_for_relation_name from 'type' to 'relation_name' to match ERGraph storage
- One-hop neighbors tool now returns actual relationship names instead of "unknown_relationship"

2025-06-02: GraphVisualizer Tool Implementation
- **Added**: New `GraphVisualizer` agent tool that visualizes graphs in multiple formats
  - Supports `JSON_NODES_EDGES` format (default) with nodes, edges, and metadata
  - Supports `GML` (Graph Modeling Language) format for standard graph exchange
  - Takes `graph_id` as input to retrieve graphs from context
  - Returns structured output with graph representation, format used, and status message
  
- **Modified**: Updated tool infrastructure
  - Added `GraphVisualizerInput` and `GraphVisualizerOutput` Pydantic models in `Core/AgentSchema/tool_contracts.py`
  - Created `Core/AgentTools/graph_visualization_tools.py` with `visualize_graph` function
  - Registered new tool as `"graph.Visualize"` in `Core/AgentOrchestrator/orchestrator.py`
  
- **Testing**: Created comprehensive test suite
  - Added `testing/test_graph_visualization_tool.py` with 6 test cases
  - Tests cover JSON/GML formats, error handling, default behavior, and edge cases
  - All tests passing successfully
  
- **Design Decisions**:
  - Tool retrieves graphs from GraphRAGContext using `get_graph_instance()` method
  - Supports flexible graph instance structures by checking multiple attributes
  - Provides detailed error messages for debugging
  - Uses standard NetworkX methods for format conversion

2025-06-02: GraphAnalyzer Tool Implementation
- **Implemented GraphAnalyzer Tool for Graph Metrics Calculation**
  - Added Pydantic input/output models to `Core/AgentSchema/tool_contracts.py`:
    - `GraphAnalyzerInput`: Accepts graph_id, optional metrics list, top_k_nodes for centrality, and expensive metrics flag
    - `GraphAnalyzerOutput`: Returns comprehensive graph metrics including basic stats, centrality, clustering, connectivity, components, and paths
  - Created `Core/AgentTools/graph_analysis_tools.py` with `analyze_graph` function
  - Features:

    - **Clustering Metrics**: Average clustering coefficient, transitivity, triangle count
    - **Connectivity Metrics**: Strong/weak connectivity for directed graphs
    - **Component Analysis**: Detailed metrics for each connected component
    - **Path Metrics**: Average shortest path length, diameter
  - Performance optimizations:
    - Selective metric calculation to reduce computation
    - Configurable expensive metric calculation (e.g., betweenness centrality)
    - Top-K filtering for centrality results
    - Warnings for skipped computations on large graphs
  - Registered tool in orchestrator as "graph.Analyze"
  - Created comprehensive unit tests in `testing/test_graph_analysis_tool.py`:
    - 9 test functions covering all metric types
    - Tests for performance with large graphs
    - Error handling tests for invalid inputs
    - All tests passing successfully
  - Integration:
    - Uses same GraphRAGContext pattern as other tools
    - Retrieves graphs via `context.get_graph_instance(graph_id)`
    - Consistent error handling and messaging

- **Design Decisions**:
  - Tool designed to be extensible for additional metrics
  - Leverages NetworkX for all graph computations
  - Provides detailed status messages and warnings
  - Handles both directed and undirected graphs appropriately

2025-06-02: GraphRAG Project Refactoring Log
Overall Goal: Decouple GraphRAG into Building, Querying, and Analyzing Stages
MVP Definition:
    1. Build Mode: Takes a dataset and configuration, then outputs persisted graph data, vector store indexes, and any other necessary artifacts (e.g., chunk data, community reports).
    2. Query Mode: Takes a query and configuration (pointing to a pre-built dataset's artifacts), loads the artifacts, and returns an answer.
    3. Evaluation Mode (Optional for MVP, but good to keep separate): Takes query results and evaluates them.
I. Modifications to Existing Files
    1. main.py
        ○ Current Functionality: Runs the entire pipeline: data loading, graph building, querying, and evaluation in one go.
        ○ Required Changes:
            § Refactor to support distinct operational modes using argparse.
                □ build: Executes graph construction, indexing, and artifact persistence.
                □ query: Loads persisted artifacts and executes a user query.
                □ evaluate: (Can remain similar) Evaluates results from a file.
            § The main section will parse the mode and call a corresponding new handler function or method.
            § Example structure:
if __name__ == "__main__":
    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser()
    parser.add_argument("mode", choices=["build", "query", "evaluate"], help="Operation mode")
    parser.add_argument("-opt", type=str, required=True, help="Path to option YAML file.")
    parser.add_argument("-dataset_name", type=str, required=True, help="Name of the dataset/experiment.")
    parser.add_argument("-question", type=str, help="Question for query mode.")
    # ... other specific args for each mode ...
    args = parser.parse_args()

# opt = Config.parse(Path(args.opt), dataset_name=args.dataset_name) # Load config once

if args.mode == "build":
        # Call new build_pipeline function/method
        # build_pipeline(opt, args.dataset_name)
        pass
    elif args.mode == "query":
        if not args.question:
            parser.error("-question is required for query mode.")
        # Call new query_pipeline function/method
        # answer = query_pipeline(opt, args.dataset_name, args.question)
        # print(answer)
        pass
    elif args.mode == "evaluate":
        # Similar to current evaluation logic, but ensure it reads from a results file
        pass
            § Remove the current monolithic execution flow.
    2. Core/GraphRAG.py
        ○ Current Functionality: Central class managing the entire process.
        ○ Required Changes:
            § Decouple Initialization:
                □ The __init__ method should initialize common components (LLM, basic config).
                □ Introduce async def setup_for_building(self, corpus_docs_list): method. This will:
                    ® Initialize DocChunk and run build_chunks.
                    ® Initialize Graph builder (e.g., ERGraph) and run build_graph.
                    ® Initialize Index builders (e.g., VectorIndex) for entities, relations, etc.
                    ® Initialize Community builder (if enabled).
                    ® Call the respective build_index and cluster/generate_community_report methods.
                    ® Ensure all artifacts are saved using standardized paths (see ArtifactManager below).
                □ Introduce async def setup_for_querying(self): method. This will:
                    ® Load persisted DocChunk data (if needed for querying directly).
                    ® Load persisted Graph from file.
                    ® Load persisted Index instances from their storage paths.
                    ® Load persisted Community data.
                    ® Initialize the _querier (Core/Query/ logic).
            § Modify insert method: Rename to something like async def build_and_persist_artifacts(self, corpus_docs_list): and have it call setup_for_building. This method will only be used in "build" mode.
            § Modify query method: Ensure it first calls setup_for_querying (if not already done) to load all necessary artifacts. It should not trigger any building or indexing.
            § The _build_retriever_context method needs to be aware of the mode. In "build" mode, it might not be fully necessary, or it might configure components for writing. In "query" mode, it configures components for reading/using pre-built artifacts.
    3. Core/Graph/BaseGraph.py (and implementations like ERGraph.py, RKGraph.py, TreeGraph.py, PassageGraph.py)
        ○ Current Functionality: Defines graph building and persistence.
        ○ Required Changes:
            § Method build_graph(self, chunks, force: bool = False): This will be called by GraphRAG.setup_for_building. Ensure force flag is respected.
            § Method _persist_graph(self, force=False): Ensure this uses a standardized path from ArtifactManager or self.workspace for saving (e.g., self.namespace.get_save_path(self.name)).
            § Method _load_graph(self, force: bool = False): Ensure this uses the standardized path for loading. This will be called by GraphRAG.setup_for_querying.
    4. Core/Index/BaseIndex.py (and implementations like VectorIndex.py, FaissIndex.py, ColBertIndex.py)
        ○ Current Functionality: Defines index building, persistence, and retrieval.
        ○ Required Changes:
            § Method build_index(self, elements, meta_data, force=False): Called by GraphRAG.setup_for_building.
            § Method _storage_index(self): Ensure uses standardized path from ArtifactManager or self.config.persist_path (which should be derived from workspace).
            § Method _load_index(self) -> bool: Ensure uses standardized path. Called by GraphRAG.setup_for_querying.
    5. Core/Chunk/DocChunk.py
        ○ Current Functionality: Chunks documents and manages persistence of chunk data.
        ○ Required Changes:
            § Method build_chunks(self, docs, force=True): Called by GraphRAG.setup_for_building.
            § Method _load_chunk(self, force=False): Called by GraphRAG.setup_for_querying if direct access to chunk data is needed during querying.
            § Ensure self._chunk.persist() and self._chunk.load_chunk() use standardized paths via its namespace.
    6. Core/Community/BaseCommunity.py (and LeidenCommunity.py)
        ○ Current Functionality: Community detection and report generation with persistence.
        ○ Required Changes:
            § Methods cluster(...) and generate_community_report(...): Called by GraphRAG.setup_for_building.
            § Methods _load_community_report(...) and _load_cluster_map(...): Called by GraphRAG.setup_for_querying.
            § Ensure persistence methods use standardized paths via self.namespace.
    7. Option/Config2.py
        ○ Current Functionality: Parses and merges configuration files.
        ○ Required Changes:
            § No major structural change needed immediately for the MVP's decoupling, as the mode will be passed via CLI.
            § Crucially, ensure that working_dir and exp_name (or a new dataset_id/artifact_id) are consistently used by the new ArtifactManager (see below) or directly within storage classes to define artifact locations. This allows the "query" mode to find what the "build" mode saved.
            § The various Option/Method/*.yaml files will now more clearly define either a "build configuration" (how to construct the graph and indexes) or a "query configuration" (how to retrieve and answer). Some parameters might be relevant to both.
    8. Core/Query/BaseQuery.py (and its implementations)
        ○ Current Functionality: Handles the logic of query processing.
        ○ Required Changes:
            § These will primarily be used in "query" mode via GraphRAG.query().
            § Ensure they correctly use the components (graph, VDBs) loaded by GraphRAG.setup_for_querying(). No direct file loading here; all dependencies should come from the initialized GraphRAG instance.
    9. Core/Retriever/MixRetriever.py (and other retrievers)
        ○ Current Functionality: Retrieves information.
        ○ Required Changes:
            § When initialized by GraphRAG in "query" mode, ensure they are operating on loaded indexes and graph data, not attempting to build or modify them.
II. New Files to Create
    1. Core/Pipelines/build_pipeline.py (or integrate as a function in main.py)
        ○ Functionality:
            § Contains a primary function async def run_build_pipeline(config: Config, dataset_name: str, corpus_path: str):.
            § Instantiates GraphRAG(config=config).
            § Loads corpus data using RAGQueryDataset(data_dir=os.path.join(config.data_root, dataset_name)).get_corpus().
            § Calls await graphrag_instance.build_and_persist_artifacts(corpus_docs_list).
            § Handles overall orchestration for the build process, logging, and error handling for this stage.
    2. Core/Pipelines/query_pipeline.py (or integrate as a function in main.py)
        ○ Functionality:
            § Contains a primary function async def run_query_pipeline(config: Config, dataset_name: str, question: str) -> str:.
            § Instantiates GraphRAG(config=config).
            § Calls await graphrag_instance.setup_for_querying() to load all artifacts for the given dataset_name.
            § Calls answer = await graphrag_instance.query(question).
            § Returns the answer.
            § Handles overall orchestration for the query process.
    3. Core/Storage/ArtifactManager.py (Highly Recommended)
        ○ Functionality:
            § A class or module to centralize the logic for determining storage and loading paths for all artifacts.
            § ArtifactManager(base_working_dir: str, dataset_name: str)
            § Methods:
                □ get_graph_file_path(graph_type_name: str) -> Path
                □ get_entity_vdb_dir() -> Path
                □ get_relation_vdb_dir() -> Path
                □ get_subgraph_vdb_dir() -> Path
                □ get_chunk_storage_dir() -> Path (for DocChunk persistence)
                □ get_community_report_path() -> Path
                □ get_community_node_map_path() -> Path
                □ get_e2r_map_path() -> Path
                □ get_r2c_map_path() -> Path
            § This manager would be instantiated within GraphRAG (or the new pipeline files) using config.working_dir and dataset_name.
            § All storage classes (NetworkXStorage, VectorIndex, DocChunk, LeidenCommunity, PickleBlobStorage for maps) would then request their specific paths from this manager instead of constructing them using self.namespace.get_save_path(self.name) directly. This ensures consistency.
            § GraphRAG would pass the correct Namespace object (or direct paths from ArtifactManager) to its components. For example, self.graph.namespace = self.artifact_manager.get_graph_namespace() or self.entities_vdb.config.persist_path = self.artifact_manager.get_entity_vdb_dir().
    4. Core/Operator/Transformations/ (Directory)
        ○ Functionality: Placeholder for your PhD-specific transformation operators.
        ○ Files (Examples):
            § extract_categorical_value.py: Implements the extract_categorical_value operator.
            § distribution_calculators.py: Implements to_categorical_distribution, to_statistical_distribution.
            § causal_path_finder.py: Implements find_causal_paths.
            § intervention_simulator.py: Implements simulate_intervention.
        ○ Each file would define classes/functions for these operations. They would typically take graph elements or dataframes as input and produce new/modified data.
        ○ Note: For the MVP of decoupling, these are not strictly needed yet, but the structure should anticipate them. The immediate focus is on separating the existing build and query.
Workflow Summary for MVP:
Build Mode (python main.py build ...)
    1. main.py calls run_build_pipeline().
    2. run_build_pipeline instantiates GraphRAG.
    3. GraphRAG.build_and_persist_artifacts():
        ○ Loads corpus.
        ○ DocChunk.build_chunks() -> saves chunk data (via ArtifactManager path).
        ○ BaseGraph_instance.build_graph() -> saves graph file (via ArtifactManager path).
        ○ BaseIndex_instance.build_index() for entities -> saves VDB (via ArtifactManager path).
        ○ (Similarly for relations, subgraphs, communities, e2r/r2c maps if enabled).
Query Mode (python main.py query ...)
    1. main.py calls run_query_pipeline().
    2. run_query_pipeline instantiates GraphRAG.
    3. GraphRAG.setup_for_querying():
        ○ Loads graph file (from ArtifactManager path).
        ○ Loads VDBs (from ArtifactManager paths).
        ○ Loads other necessary persisted data.
        ○ Initializes query engine and retrievers with loaded components.
    4. GraphRAG.query(question) executes the query using the loaded artifacts.
    5. run_query_pipeline returns the answer.
This refactoring will make your system much cleaner, allowing the expensive graph construction to be a separate, offline step. The "usage" aspect then becomes about loading these pre-computed artifacts to quickly answer questions or, in the future, run more complex analytic chains.

GraphRAG Project Refactoring Log Pt2

**Overall Goal:** Transition the GraphRAG project from an end-to-end testing suite into a modular and flexible "usage suite" with decoupled stages for graph building, querying, and analysis, suitable for the user's PhD research on social media discourse analysis.

*Phases 0 and 1 (Steps 1-9) are documented in "GraphRAG Project Refactoring Log," "GraphRAG Project Refactoring Log Pt2," and "GraphRAG Project Refactoring Log Pt3".*

**Phase 1: Data Preparation & Initial Decoupling Steps (Continued)**

*Steps 1-6 are documented in "GraphRAG Project Refactoring Log Pt2".*

**Step 7: Implement Advanced RAPTOR Retrieval Strategies (In Progress)**
* **Objective:** Enhance RAPTOR query logic beyond simple VDB search of all tree nodes, incorporating strategies like tree traversal or node clustering/re-ranking.
* **Sub-Step 7.1: Retrieve Node Metadata (ID, Layer, Score) along with Text (Debugging Layer/Score Info)**
    * **Previous Actions:**
        1.  Modified `Core/Storage/TreeGraphStorage.py`.
        2.  Refined `Core/Schema/VdbResult.py`.
        3.  Modified `Core/Retriever/EntitiyRetriever.py`.
        4.  Modified `Core/Query/BasicQuery.py`.
        5.  Modified `Core/GraphRAG.py` to force VDB rebuild.
        6.  Refined `Core/Index/BaseIndex.py` (`build_index` method).
        7.  Refined `Core/Index/FaissIndex.py` (`_update_index` method) and fixed subsequent `IndentationError`.
    * **Outcome of Build Command (After Indentation Fix & VDB Rebuild):**
        * `IndentationError` in `FaissIndex.py` resolved.
        * Build command completed successfully.
        * Logs confirm VDB was deleted and rebuilt with `force=True` and correct metadata keys (`['index', 'layer']`).
    * **Outcome of Query Command (Latest):**
        * `Layer` information for retrieved nodes is now correctly logged as `0`.
    * **Issue Identified:** `Score` for retrieved nodes is still logged as `N/A`.
    * **Hypothesis:** The VDB scores are not being correctly unpacked or assigned in `Core/Retriever/EntitiyRetriever.py` after being returned from `Core/Schema/VdbResult.py`.
    * **Action (Current):**
        1.  Apply suggested modifications to `Core/Retriever/EntitiyRetriever.py`'s `_find_relevant_entities_vdb` method to add detailed logging for the `scores` variable and ensure robust handling of the `nodes_with_metadata` list before adding `vdb_score`.
    * **Expected Outcome:** Query logs will show the actual list of scores received from the VDB, helping to pinpoint if scores are missing or if the assignment logic is flawed. Subsequently, the main log should show actual float scores.
    * **Status:** Code modification instructions for `Core/Retriever/EntitiyRetriever.py` were provided in the previous turn (response #10). User to apply these and re-run the query.

**(Further steps will be added here as we proceed)**

# GraphRAG Project Refactoring Log Pt 4

**Overall Goal:** Transition the GraphRAG project from an end-to-end testing suite into a modular and flexible "usage suite" with decoupled stages for graph building, querying, and analysis, suitable for the user's PhD research on social media discourse analysis.

*Phases 0 and 1 (Steps 1-9) are documented in "GraphRAG Project Refactoring Log," "GraphRAG Project Refactoring Log Pt2," and "GraphRAG Project Refactoring Log Pt3". "GraphRAG Project Refactoring Log Pt 4" concluded with Step 23. This log, Part 5, details all subsequent steps starting from Step 24.*

**Phase 1: Data Preparation & Initial Decoupling Steps (Continued)**

**Step 24: Determine Logging Configuration and Capture Query Logs**
* **Status:** Completed.

**Step 25: Investigate `LeidenCommunity` and Context Propagation; Capture Missing Logs**
* **Status:** Completed.

**Step 26: Implement Public `community_node_map` Property in `LeidenCommunity` (Completed)**
* **Status:** Completed.

**Step 27: Inspect `community_node_map.json` and Entity ID Lookup in `EntityRetriever` (Completed)**
* **Status:** Completed.

**Step 28: Verify `EntityRetriever` Lookup Logic and Test with Known Mapped Entity (Completed)**
* **Status:** Completed.

**Step 29: Verify `CommunityRetriever` Uses Attached Cluster Info to Fetch Reports (Error Identified, Addressed in Step 30 & 31)**
* **Status:** Completed.

**Step 30: Ensure Detailed Logging in `CommunityRetriever` and Re-Test Report Fetching (Error Identified & Fixed in Step 31)**
* **Status:** Completed.

**Step 31: Fix `TypeError` in `CommunityRetriever` and Re-Test Report Fetching (New Error Identified)**
* **Status:** Completed. `TypeError` resolved. New `AttributeError` identified.

**Step 32: Correct Config Path for `level` and other `QueryConfig` Attributes in `CommunityRetriever` (New Error Identified)**
* **Recap:** `AttributeError` occurred due to incorrect config path. IDE self-corrected to use `self.retriever_context.context["query"]`, leading to `KeyError: 'query'`.
* **Status:** `KeyError` cause identified: `QueryConfig` was not registered in `RetrieverContext.context` under the key `"query"`.
Step 33: Register QueryConfig into RetrieverContext and Update Access in CommunityRetriever (Partially Successful - GGraphRAG Test)
    • Objective: Ensure QueryConfig is available in RetrieverContext.context (under key "query_config") and correctly accessed by CommunityRetriever.
    • Action (User to IDE in response #23, IDE executed in response #24, further corrections by IDE in response #25, then testing GGraphRAG in response #26):
        1. Modifications to Core/GraphRAG.py (to register "query_config") and Core/Retriever/CommunityRetriever.py (to access QueryConfig attributes via self.retriever_context.context["query_config"].<attribute>) were applied by the IDE.
        2. IDE ran build for GGraphRAG.yaml: Successful.
        3. IDE ran query for GGraphRAG.yaml with question "What were the key causes of the American Revolution?" (./ggraphrag_query.log or full_query_output_attempt12.log).
    • Outcome (From IDE Logs in response #26, full_query_output_attempt12.log):
        ○ Build Success: GGraphRAG artifacts (graph, VDBs, community map with 14 entries, 2 community reports) were created successfully.
        ○ Query Artifact Loading: All artifacts loaded successfully for the query.
        ○ Persistent AttributeError: The query still crashed with AttributeError: 'RetrieverConfig' object has no attribute 'level' in Core/Retriever/CommunityRetriever.py within the find_relevant_community_by_level method, specifically at the line if v.level <= self.config.level.
    • Diagnosis: Despite the IDE reporting it had applied the fix to use self.retriever_context.context["query_config"].level, the traceback from the latest execution shows the code is still attempting to use self.config.level. This indicates the edit to CommunityRetriever.find_relevant_community_by_level was not effectively applied or saved for all necessary instances.
    • Status: The build for GGraphRAG is fine. The query mode fails because CommunityRetriever.find_relevant_community_by_level is still using the incorrect path to QueryConfig attributes.
Step 34: Systematically Test Build and Query for Remaining Methods (GGraphRAG - Fixes Applied & Successful!)
    • Objective: Ensure the fix for accessing QueryConfig attributes is correctly and completely applied to CommunityRetriever.find_relevant_community_by_level and test the GGraphRAG query path.
    • Action (User to IDE in response #27, IDE executed in response #28):
        1. IDE confirmed that the previous edits to CommunityRetriever.find_relevant_community_by_level (to use self.retriever_context.context["query_config"].level etc.) were not fully applied or were incorrect, as the AttributeError: 'RetrieverConfig' object has no attribute 'level' persisted.
        2. IDE iteratively applied further corrections to Core/Retriever/CommunityRetriever.py to:
            § Correctly use self.retriever_context.context["query_config"].<attribute_name> for all QueryConfig parameters.
            § Address a subsequent TypeError by ensuring global_max_consider_community was cast to int.
            § Address a subsequent KeyError: 'community_info' by ensuring the data structure returned by find_relevant_community_by_level matched downstream expectations in Core/Query/BaseQuery.py (by wrapping community data in a {"community_info": c, ...} structure).
        3. IDE re-ran the GGraphRAG build (successful) and query: python main.py query -opt Option/Method/GGraphRAG.yaml -dataset_name MySampleTexts -question "What were the key causes of the American Revolution?" > ./ggraphrag_query_attempt13.log 2>&1.
    • Outcome (From IDE Logs in response #28, ggraphrag_query_attempt13.log):
        ○ SUCCESS! All identified AttributeError, TypeError, and KeyError issues in the GGraphRAG query path related to CommunityRetriever and QueryConfig access are resolved.
        ○ GGraphRAG Query Path Functional: The GGraphRAG query completed successfully.
        ○ Logs Indicate Global Path Execution: The system correctly identified it was a global query, community reports were likely retrieved (though detailed logs for this specific part were truncated, the successful completion and answer generation imply it worked).
        ○ Answer Generated: A synthesized answer regarding the causes of the American Revolution was produced, indicating the end-to-end global query pipeline for GGraphRAG is now working.
    • Status: The GGraphRAG build and query (global search path using communities) modes are now functionally working in the decoupled framework.
Next Phase: Continue Method Verification or Shift to Evaluation
Step 35: Plan Next Steps for Method Verification or Evaluation
    • Objective: Decide whether to continue verifying the build and query functionality for other RAG methods or to begin developing/testing the evaluate mode.
    • Considerations:
        ○ Methods still needing specific tests (from graphrag_method_status_table):
            § KGP (passage_graph)
            § ToG (er_graph with specific ToGQuery)
            § Dalk (er_graph with specific DalkQuery)
            § GR (G-Retriever) (er_graph with specific GRQuery)
            § LightRAG (rkg_graph - likely works but specific keyword features not stressed).
        ○ Advanced RAPTOR strategies beyond basic VDB lookup.
    • Status: Pending decision.
Step 36: Systematically Test Build and Query for GR (G-Retriever) (Successful!)
    • Status: Completed. The GR (G-Retriever) build and query modes are functionally working.
Step 37: Systematically Test Build and Query for Dalk (Build Success, Initial Query Error)
    • Status: Completed (Details in previous log entries).
Step 38: Fix KeyError: 'content' in DalkQuery.py (Successful!)
    • Objective: Modify DalkQuery.py to use an appropriate existing edge attribute (e.g., relation_name or description) instead of content when formatting path and neighbor information.
    • Action (User to IDE in response #36, IDE executed in response #37):
        1. IDE applied the fix: changed e["content"] to e.get("relation_name", e.get("description", "unknown_relation")) in DalkQuery.py.
        2. IDE re-ran the Dalk query.
    • Outcome (From IDE Summary in response #37):
        ○ KeyError Resolved: The Dalk query pipeline completed without the KeyError.
        ○ Dalk Query Functional: Artifacts loaded, and the DalkQuery multi-step reasoning process executed successfully.
        ○ Answer Generated: A comprehensive answer was produced.
    • Status: The Dalk build and query modes are now functionally working in the decoupled framework.
Next Phase: Continue Method Verification
Step 39: Systematically Test Build and Query for ToG (Think-on-Graph)
    • Objective: Verify the decoupled build and query modes for the ToG method. ToG uses an er_graph and a specific ToGQuery module with agent-like reasoning.
    • Status: Pending.
Step 40: Systematically Test Build and Query for KGP (Knowledge Graph Prompting) (Successful!)
    • Status: Completed. The KGP (Knowledge Graph Prompting) build and query modes are functionally working.
Next Phase: Final Method Verification (RAPTOR Advanced Strategies) & Evaluation Planning
Step 41: Systematically Test RAPTOR's Multi-Level Tree Retrieval (Core Mechanism Verified)
    • Objective: Verify that RAPTOR's build process creates a multi-layer tree and that its query process (using VDB search across all tree nodes) can retrieve nodes from various layers, including summarized parent nodes.
    • Action (User to IDE in response #42, IDE executed in response #43):
        1. IDE ran build for RAPTOR.yaml on MySampleTexts dataset.
        2. IDE ran query for RAPTOR.yaml with question "Summarize the main conflicts described in the texts.".
        3. IDE provided a summary of log highlights.
    • Outcome (From IDE Summary in response #43):
        ○ Build Success: RAPTOR build created a tree_graph_balanced. For the small MySampleTexts dataset (5 chunks/leaf nodes), the process resulted in a single-layer tree (5 nodes, all at layer 0). VDB for tree nodes was built successfully with index and layer metadata.
        ○ Query Success:
            § All artifacts loaded correctly.
            § The tree_search: True path in BasicQuery.py was executed.
            § EntityRetriever logs confirmed that all retrieved nodes had "layer": 0, consistent with the single-layer tree built.
            § The query completed without errors and an answer was generated.
    • Diagnosis: The core RAPTOR pipeline (tree graph construction, VDB indexing of tree nodes with layer metadata, and querying these nodes) is operational. The absence of multi-layer retrieval in this test is due to the small dataset size not triggering the formation of higher summary layers, rather than a flaw in the RAPTOR-specific logic.
    • Status: The RAPTOR build and query modes are functionally working. The ability to handle layer metadata is verified. Testing actual retrieval from multiple layers would require a larger dataset or adjusted tree construction parameters.
Step 42: Conclude Initial Method Verification Phase
    • Objective: Acknowledge that all listed methods have had an initial successful build and query run in the decoupled framework.
    • Status: Completed.
Phase 2: Implementing Evaluation Mode
Step 43: Implement Basic evaluate Mode Workflow in main.py (Completed)
    • Status: The foundational code for the evaluate mode workflow was implemented in main.py.
Step 44: Test the Implemented evaluate Mode (Successful for LGraphRAG!)
    • Status: The basic evaluate mode is functionally working for LGraphRAG.
Step 45: Systematically Test evaluate Mode for Other Verified RAG Methods (GGraphRAG - Successful!)
    • Status: The basic evaluate mode is functionally working for GGraphRAG.
Step 46: Systematically Test evaluate Mode for RAPTOR (Successful!)
    • Objective: Ensure the evaluate mode works correctly with the RAPTOR method and its tree-based graph structure.
    • Action (User to IDE in response #50, IDE executed in response #51):
        1. IDE re-ran build for RAPTOR on MySampleTexts.
        2. IDE ran evaluate mode for RAPTOR on MySampleTexts.
    • Outcome (From IDE Summary & Logs in response #51):
        ○ Evaluation Pipeline Functional for RAPTOR: Build completed. Dataset and artifacts loaded for evaluation; all questions queried; query outputs saved to method-specific directory; Evaluator invoked; metrics calculated, saved, and printed (accuracy': 40.0, 'f1': 38.10..., 'precision': 28.02..., 'recall': 85.03..., 'em': 0.0).
    • Status: The basic evaluate mode is now functionally working for RAPTOR.
Next Phase: Conclude Basic Evaluation Testing & Plan Future Work
Step 47: Conclude Basic evaluate Mode Testing
    • Objective: Acknowledge that the evaluate mode has been successfully tested across methods with different graph structures (RKG with communities, Tree graph).
    • Status: Completed.

Lessons Learned (Cumulative):
    • Explicit Interfaces are Key: (Reinforced).
    • Stateful Initialization for Modes: (Reinforced).
    • Data Dependency & Alignment: (Reinforced).
    • Importance of Precise Logging: (Reinforced).
    • Testing with Known Positives: (Reinforced).
    • Tooling Limitations: Automated code editing can be unreliable, especially with similar code blocks or if not perfectly targeted. Manual verification of applied changes is sometimes necessary.
    • Data Type Consistency: (Reinforced).
    • Defensive Programming: (Reinforced).
    • Impact of Errors on Logging: (Reinforced).
    • Configuration Scope & Context Propagation: (Reinforced).
    • Verify Edits: When an automated tool reports an edit, it's crucial to confirm from subsequent error messages or behavior that the edit was indeed applied as intended.

# GraphRAG Project Handoff Document

**Date:** May 20, 2025
**Project:** DIGIMON / GraphRAG Refactoring and UI Development
**GitHub Repository:** `https://github.com/BrianMills2718/Digimon_KG` (as last mentioned by user)

## 1. Project Overview

The DIGIMON/GraphRAG project, originally an end-to-end testing suite for various Graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation methods, has been undergoing a significant refactoring.
**Overall Goal:** Transition the project into a modular and flexible "usage suite" with decoupled stages for graph building, querying, and analysis. This is intended to support PhD research on social media discourse analysis.
A key recent development is the creation of a web-based UI to interact with the Python backend.

**Current State:**
* **Python Backend (WSL - `~/digimon`):**
    * The core Python logic has been refactored into distinct modes: `build` (for artifact generation), `query` (for question answering), and `evaluate` (for performance assessment), managed by `main.py`.
    * All listed RAG methods (LGraphRAG, GGraphRAG, LightRAG, GR, Dalk, ToG, KGP, RAPTOR, HippoRAG) have been verified to successfully run their `build` and `query` modes with a sample dataset (`MySampleTexts`).
    * The `evaluate` mode has been implemented in `main.py` and successfully tested with LGraphRAG, GGraphRAG, and RAPTOR.
    * A basic Flask API server (`api.py`) has been created in the WSL backend. It currently has a functional `/api/query` endpoint that can receive requests, initialize the `GraphRAG` system, perform a query, and return the answer. Placeholders for `/api/build` and `/api/evaluate` exist.
    * The Python backend runs in a Conda environment (`digimon`).
* **React Frontend (`C:\Users\Brian\graphrag-ui`):**
    * A React project was initialized (e.g., using `create-react-app` or `vite`).
    * The UI code (from Canvas `graphrag_ui_v1`) has been integrated into this React project. This UI allows users to select datasets, RAG methods, trigger build/query/evaluate operations, and view results/logs.
    * The React UI has been modified to make `Workspace` API calls to the Flask backend (`http://localhost:5000/api/query`) for the "Run Query" functionality, replacing the initial simulation logic.
    * The "Build Artifacts" and "Run Evaluation" buttons in the UI currently call the Flask API, but their respective backend endpoints (`/api/build`, `/api/evaluate` in `api.py`) are placeholders and need full implementation.
* **Development Environment:**
    * The user develops the Python backend within a WSL Ubuntu environment.
    * The React frontend is developed on the Windows host system.
    * The two components are intended to communicate over the local network (React UI on `http://localhost:3001` calling Flask API on `http://localhost:5000` from WSL).

## 2. Refactoring Journey Summary

The refactoring process has been documented in "GraphRAG Project Refactoring Log Pt 1-5". Key phases and steps included:

* **Phase 0: Initial Setup & Baseline:** Git version control established.
* **Phase 1: Data Preparation & Initial Decoupling:**
    * Created corpus preparation scripts.
    * Refactored `main.py` to support `build`, `query`, and `evaluate` modes.
    * Extensive debugging of Pydantic v2 compatibility issues, attribute errors, `KeyError`s, and `TypeError`s across various modules, particularly in configuration loading, storage classes, context propagation (`RetrieverContext`), and retriever logic (`EntityRetriever`, `CommunityRetriever`).
    * Systematic verification of `build` and `query` modes for all core RAG methods (LGraphRAG, GGraphRAG, LightRAG, GR, Dalk, ToG, KGP, RAPTOR).
* **Phase 2: Implementing Evaluation Mode & UI Development:**
    * Implemented and tested the `evaluate` mode in `main.py` for several methods.
    * Initiated UI development with React.
    * Set up a Flask API in the WSL backend to bridge the Python logic with the React UI.
    * Modified the React UI to call the `/api/query` backend endpoint.

**Key Lessons Learned from Refactoring:**
* Explicit interfaces and clear data contracts are crucial for decoupled components.
* Stateful initialization and context propagation across modes and components require careful management.
* Configuration systems must be precise and robust.
* Pydantic enforces rigor but requires careful class design.
* Detailed, iterative logging is essential for debugging complex interactions.
* Data schema consistency (e.g., for edge attributes, entity IDs) is vital.
* Tooling limitations (e.g., IDE auto-edits) can sometimes require manual intervention.

## 3. Current UI and Backend API Setup

### 3.1. React Frontend (`C:\Users\Brian\graphrag-ui`)

* **Core File:** `src/App.js` (or `src.App.jsx`) contains the UI logic from the Canvas document `graphrag_ui_v1`.
* **Dependencies:** `react`, `react-dom`, `lucide-react`. Tailwind CSS is used for styling.
* **Functionality:**
    * Allows selection of dataset name and RAG method.
    * "Build Artifacts" button: Calls `/api/build` (backend endpoint is a placeholder).
    * "Run Query" button: Takes a question and calls `/api/query` (backend endpoint is functional). Displays the answer.
    * "Run Evaluation" button: Calls `/api/evaluate` (backend endpoint is a placeholder).
    * Displays logs and status messages.
* **To Run:**
    1.  Navigate to `C:\Users\Brian\graphrag-ui` in a Windows terminal (CMD or PowerShell).
    2.  Run `npm start` (or `npm run dev` if using Vite).
    3.  Access the UI in a browser, typically at `http://localhost:3000` or `http://localhost:3001`.

### 3.2. Python Flask Backend API (`~/digimon/api.py` in WSL)

* **Core File:** `api.py`
* **Dependencies:** `Flask`, `Flask-CORS`. (Python dependencies for GraphRAG itself are managed by the `digimon` conda environment).
* **Endpoints:**
    * `POST /api/query`: **Functional.** Receives `datasetName`, `selectedMethod`, `question`. Initializes `GraphRAG` (with basic instance caching), loads artifacts, runs the query, and returns the answer as JSON.
    * `POST /api/build`: **Placeholder.** Receives payload but does not yet execute the build logic.
    * `POST /api/evaluate`: **Placeholder.** Receives payload but does not yet execute the evaluation logic.
* **To Run:**
    1.  Open a WSL Ubuntu terminal.
    2.  Navigate to `~/digimon`.
    3.  Activate the conda environment: `conda activate digimon`.
    4.  Run the server: `python api.py`.
    5.  The API will be available at `http://localhost:5000` from your Windows host.

## 4. Next Steps for Development (Especially Frontend & Full Functionality)

### 4.1. Fully Implement Backend API Endpoints

1.  **`/api/build` Endpoint:**
    * Modify `api.py`'s `handle_build` function.
    * It should receive `datasetName` and `selectedMethod` (which maps to a config file path).
    * Parse the `Config`.
    * Instantiate `GraphRAG`.
    * Call `await graphrag_instance.build_and_persist_artifacts()`.
    * Return a success/failure message. This is a long-running task; consider how to handle this (e.g., async task, polling from UI, or just a simple blocking call for now).
2.  **`/api/evaluate` Endpoint:**
    * Modify `api.py`'s `handle_evaluate` function.
    * It should receive `datasetName` and `selectedMethod`.
    * This will be more complex as the current `handle_evaluate_mode` in `main.py` itself performs multiple queries and then evaluation. You might need to:
        * Either replicate that logic within the API endpoint.
        * Or refactor `handle_evaluate_mode` from `main.py` into a callable function that the API can use.
    * The endpoint should save results to files (as `main.py` does) and perhaps return a summary of metrics or a path to the metrics file. Also a long-running task.

### 4.2. Enhance React UI

1.  **Integrate Build & Evaluate API Calls:**
    * Update `handleBuild` and `handleEvaluate` in `App.js` to make `Workspace` calls to the now functional `/api/build` and `/api/evaluate` backend endpoints.
    * Handle responses and update UI state (logs, results) accordingly.
2.  **Improve User Feedback for Long Operations:**
    * For `build` and `evaluate`, which can take time, provide better user feedback than just a simple loading spinner (e.g., progress updates if possible, or at least a persistent "Processing..." message).
    * Consider websockets or server-sent events for real-time log streaming from backend to frontend, though this adds complexity. For now, polling or just waiting might be sufficient.
3.  **Display Results More Richly:**
    * Instead of just `JSON.stringify` for evaluation metrics, parse the JSON and display it in a more readable format (e.g., a table).
    * Consider how to display logs from the backend if they are returned via the API.
4.  **Error Handling:** Improve error display and recovery in the UI.
5.  **Configuration Management in UI:**
    * Allow dynamic loading/selection of datasets (perhaps by scanning `./Data/` via a backend endpoint).
    * Potentially allow viewing or even minor editing of method configurations (advanced).
6.  **Styling and UX:** General improvements to user experience.

### 4.3. Shareability (Dockerization & Deployment)

1.  **Backend Dockerfile (`~/digimon/Dockerfile.backend`):**
    * Start from a Python base image.
    * Set up the conda environment (or install dependencies via `pip` from a `requirements.txt` generated from the conda env).
    * Copy the entire `digimon` project directory.
    * Expose port 5000.
    * Set the `CMD` to run `python api.py`.
2.  **Frontend Dockerfile (`~/digimon/graphrag-react-ui/Dockerfile.frontend`):**
    * Use a multi-stage build.
    * Stage 1: Node image, copy `package.json`, `package-lock.json`, run `npm install`, copy rest of UI source, run `npm run build` (to create static assets).
    * Stage 2: Nginx or other lightweight static server image, copy static assets from Stage 1.
    * Expose port 80 (or other).
3.  **`docker-compose.yml` (`~/digimon/docker-compose.yml`):**
    * Define two services: `backend` (from `Dockerfile.backend`) and `frontend` (from `Dockerfile.frontend`).
    * Set up networking so the frontend can reach the backend.
    * Map ports.
4.  **Deployment:** Once dockerized, this can be deployed to various cloud platforms or servers.

## 5. Project Structure Reminder

* **Backend (WSL):** `~/digimon/` (contains `Core`, `Option`, `Data`, `api.py`, `main.py`, etc.)
* **Frontend (Windows, but copied to WSL for unified Git repo):** `~/digimon/graphrag-react-ui/` (contains `src`, `public`, `package.json`, etc.)

This handoff document should provide a good starting point for continuing development. The immediate focus for the next developer/chatbot would likely be fully implementing the `/api/build` and `/api/evaluate` backend endpoints and then integrating them into the React UI.

## 2025-06-02 - True ReACT Implementation

### Changes Made:
1. **Implemented full ReACT (Reason-Act-Observe) loop in agent_brain.py**:
   - Replaced basic `process_query_react` with comprehensive iterative implementation
   - Added `_react_reason` method for reasoning about next steps
   - Added `_react_observe` method for processing step results
   - Added `_generate_final_answer` method for context-based answer generation
   
2. **ReACT Features Implemented**:
   - **Step-by-step execution**: Execute one step at a time instead of full plan
   - **Reasoning between steps**: LLM reasons about observations and decides next action
   - **Adaptive replanning**: Can skip steps, create new steps, or stop early
   - **Context accumulation**: Maintains context across iterations
   - **Early stopping**: Can decide when enough information is gathered
   
3. **Created test_react_implementation.py**:
   - Tests three different query types: simple, multi-step, and complex
   - Logs detailed reasoning history and observations
   - Demonstrates adaptive behavior

### Key Design Decisions:
- Max 10 iterations to prevent infinite loops
- JSON-based reasoning format for structured decisions
- Context-aware step translation considering previous results
- Comprehensive state tracking with observations and reasoning history

### Next Steps:
- Run tests to validate ReACT behavior
- Fine-tune reasoning prompts based on test results
- Consider adding more sophisticated replanning strategies

## 2025-06-02 Session - True ReACT Implementation (Part 2)

### Fixed Missing _react_reason Method
- **File**: `Core/AgentBrain/agent_brain.py`
- **Issue**: `_react_reason` method was missing, causing AttributeError
- **Fix**: Added complete _react_reason method that:
  - Analyzes current ReACT state
  - Decides whether to continue, stop, or answer
  - Returns structured reasoning decision
  - Handles JSON extraction with fallback logic

### Updated ReACT Test Script
- **File**: `testing/test_react_implementation.py`
- **Changes**:
  - Removed invalid `config.datasets.corpus_input_dir` assignment
  - Added corpus preparation step using existing text files in `Data/Fictional_Test`
  - Fixed imports for corpus preparation tools
  - Test now properly prepares corpus before running queries

### ReACT Loop Successfully Running
- **Status**: The ReACT loop is now executing iteratively
- **Observed Behavior**:
  - Proper reasoning about next steps
  - Attempting to execute tool steps
  - Non-tool steps correctly identified and logged
  - Iteration counter working correctly
  - Observations being collected after each step
  
### Current Issues to Address
- **Corpus Discovery**: The ReACT agent doesn't realize the corpus is already prepared
- **Step Translation**: Some steps fail validation when translating to ExecutionPlan
- **Context Awareness**: Agent needs better awareness of available data/tools

### Key Achievements
- ✅ Full ReACT loop implemented with reasoning, acting, and observing
- ✅ Async execution properly handled throughout
- ✅ JSON extraction robust with regex fallback
- ✅ Non-tool steps handled gracefully
- ✅ Detailed logging at each iteration
- ✅ Test corpus properly prepared before queries

### Next Steps
1. Improve agent's awareness of existing corpus data
2. Enhance step translation to handle more varied natural language steps
3. Add corpus existence checking to avoid redundant preparation attempts
4. Implement better context passing between ReACT iterations
5. Add comprehensive test cases for different query types

## 2025-06-02: ReACT Loop Testing Results

### Summary
Tested the ReACT implementation with a new test script (`test_react_with_existing_data.py`) that assumes existing corpus and builds ER graph and VDB before running queries.

### Key Changes

1. **Created New Test Script**:
   - `test_react_with_existing_data.py` - Tests ReACT with pre-built resources
   - Builds ER graph and VDB if not found
   - Runs multiple test queries

2. **Fixed Import and Schema Issues**:
   - Added `target_dataset_name` to BuildERGraphInputs
   - Fixed build_er_graph call to pass individual parameters
   - Fixed entity_vdb_build_tool parameter name

### Test Results

1. **ReACT Loop Executed Successfully**:
   - Completed 10 iterations for each query
   - Generated reasoning at each step
   - Attempted to execute various steps

2. **Issues Identified**:
   - **Resource Detection Failed**: GraphRAGContext not finding built graphs/VDBs
   - **Step Translation Problems**: Most steps marked as "non-tool" steps
   - **No Tool Execution**: No actual tools were executed
   - **Max Iterations Reached**: Loop hit 10 iteration limit without success

3. **Final Answers Generated**:
   - Query 1: "What is the main entities of the Zorathian Empire?" → Unable to find entities
   - Query 2: "Tell me about Emperor Zorthak" → No information found
   - Query 3: "What relationships exist between the Zorathian Empire and other entities?" → No details found

### Key Learnings

1. **GraphRAGContext Registration**: Graph and VDB build tools may not be properly registering resources
2. **Step Translation**: Need better mapping from natural language steps to tool calls
3. **Resource Awareness**: ReACT loop needs to better detect and use available resources

### Next Steps

1. **Fix Resource Registration**: Ensure graphs and VDBs are properly registered in GraphRAGContext
2. **Improve Step Translation**: Better map NL steps to actual tool schemas
3. **Add Direct Tool Execution**: Allow ReACT to directly execute tools when available
4. **Test with Simpler Queries**: Start with queries that map directly to single tools
5. **Debug Resource Detection**: Log what resources are available vs what's being detected

### Code Status
- ReACT loop implementation: ✅ Working (but needs improvements)
- Resource detection: ❌ Not working properly
- Step translation: ⚠️ Partially working
- Tool execution: ❌ Not executing tools
- Final answer generation: ✅ Working

### ReACT Loop: Tool Invocation Formatting in Reasoning

- **Issue**: LLM-generated actions in the ReACT loop (e.g., "Call the search_vector_db tool...") were being misclassified as "Non-tool steps". This was because the `is_tool_step` check in `PlanningAgent.process_query_react` requires actions to either contain specific prefixes (like "corpus.", "graph.") or start with "Use ". The system prompt for the `_react_reason` method did not instruct the LLM to format its tool-using actions accordingly.
- **Fix**: Updated the system prompt within the `_react_reason` method in `Core/AgentBrain/agent_brain.py`. The prompt now explicitly instructs the LLM that if its `next_step` involves calling a tool, the description **MUST** start with "Use " followed by the general action (e.g., "Use search_vector_db with ...").
- **Goal**: Ensure that LLM-generated actions intended as tool calls are correctly identified and translated into executable `ExecutionPlan` objects, enabling actual tool execution within the ReACT loop.

### ReACT Loop: Resource Registration Fix in Test Script

- **Issue**: The `PlanningAgent` in the ReACT loop was not recognizing pre-built ER graphs and VDBs prepared by `testing/test_react_with_existing_data.py`. This was because the `prepare_existing_data` function in the test script did not correctly register these resources into the `GraphRAGContext` instance.
    - The `build_er_graph` tool returned the graph instance, but the test script didn't add it to the context.
    - The `entity_vdb_build_tool` handled its own registration, but the test script's checking and logging logic for VDBs was flawed (using `get_vector_db` instead of `get_vdb_instance` and not properly checking tool output).
- **Fix**: 
    - Modified `prepare_existing_data` in `testing/test_react_with_existing_data.py`:
        - To capture the `graph_instance` from the output of `build_er_graph` and explicitly call `graphrag_context.add_graph_instance()`.
        - To correctly use `graphrag_context.get_vdb_instance()` for checking existing VDBs, and to rely on `entity_vdb_build_tool` for internal registration, improving logging around VDB preparation based on the tool's output.
- **Goal**: Ensure `PlanningAgent` correctly identifies and uses pre-existing resources, preventing unnecessary rebuild attempts in the ReACT loop during tests.

### ReACT Loop: Step Translation Enhancement (ExecutionPlan)

- **Issue**: `_translate_nl_step_to_pydantic` in `Core/AgentBrain/agent_brain.py` was failing due to Pydantic validation errors for `ExecutionPlan`. The LLM was not generating all required top-level fields (`plan_description`, `target_dataset_name`, `steps`), and the parsing logic was only attempting to populate `execution_steps`.
- **Fix Attempted**:
    - Modified the user prompt in `_translate_nl_step_to_pydantic` to explicitly instruct the LLM to generate a *complete* `ExecutionPlan` JSON, providing clear instructions on how to populate `plan_description`, `target_dataset_name` (using the current `corpus_name`), and ensuring the `steps` list contains the single translated step.
    - Updated the parsing logic to use `ExecutionPlan(**plan_json)`, expecting a full dictionary from the LLM.
    - Added more detailed logging for missing fields or parsing errors during this translation phase.
- **Goal**: To resolve the Pydantic validation errors and enable successful translation of natural language ReACT steps into executable `ExecutionPlan` objects.

## 2025-06-02 Session End: ReACT Loop Handoff

- Created handoff document `Doc/handoff_2025_06_02_react_loop_status.md` summarizing the current state of the ReACT loop implementation, key achievements, outstanding issues (primarily resource detection in GraphRAGContext and step-to-tool translation), and detailed next steps for debugging and improvement.
- The non-ReACT pipeline (via `digimon_cli.py`) was confirmed to be working, indicating underlying tools are functional.
- Focus for next session: Resolve resource detection within ReACT and improve step translation to enable actual tool execution within the loop.
