[2025-05-30 06:52] Updated Option/Config2.py:
- Made Config.default() robust: it now tries Option/Config2.example.yaml, then Option/Config2.yaml, and finally falls back to programmatic defaults for all required fields (llm, embedding, graph, chunk, retriever, query_config) to prevent ValidationError at import time.

[2025-05-30 06:58] Fixed circular import in Option/Config2.py:
- Moved `from Core.Common.Logger import logger` into the Config.default() method body to resolve ImportError due to circular dependency with Core.Common.Logger.

[2025-05-30 07:02] Fully broke circular import in Option/Config2.py:

- Removed old direct instantiation with config/namespace args.
- Updated to use async helper get_loaded_graph_instance with correct parameters, matching TestGraph construction logic and avoiding TypeError.

[2025-05-30 07:41] Updated get_loaded_graph_instance in testing/test_single_tool_entity_ppr.py:
- Now creates Workspace object and passes it to NameSpace for correct storage path resolution, aligning with project design.

[2025-05-30 07:44] Fixed async graph loading and Pydantic input error in testing/test_single_tool_entity_ppr.py:
- Awaited NetworkXStorage.load_graph(force=False) to ensure the graph is loaded and avoid RuntimeWarning.
- Added required graph_reference_id argument to EntityPPRInputs to resolve ValidationError.

[2025-05-30 07:50] Fixed graph file path logic for NetworkXStorage:
- Updated Core/Storage/NetworkXStorage.py: graphml_xml_file now joins directory from NameSpace.get_save_path() with self.name.
- Updated testing/test_single_tool_entity_ppr.py: explicitly sets _storage.name to "graph_storage_nx_data.graphml" to match actual file.

[2025-05-30 07:54] Replaced entity_ppr_tool placeholder with robust EntityRetriever-based implementation in Core/AgentTools/entity_tools.py:
- Now calls EntityRetriever._find_relevant_entities_by_ppr and returns real PPR results, handling config and context robustly.

[2025-05-30 10:06] Updated Core/Retriever/BaseRetriever.py:
- Added logger.critical("BaseRetriever: ENTERING _run_personalized_pagerank method NOW!") as the first line inside async def _run_personalized_pagerank, before any other code, for method entry diagnostics.

[2025-05-30 10:25] Enhanced diagnostic logging:
- Added logger.critical statement at the start of EntityRetriever._find_relevant_entities_by_ppr in Core/Retriever/EntitiyRetriever.py.
- Added logger.critical diagnostic statement before calling entity_retriever._find_relevant_entities_by_ppr in entity_ppr_tool in Core/AgentTools/entity_tools.py.

[2025-05-30 10:27] Bugfix: Decorator return in RetrieverFactory
- Modified register_retriever_method in Core/Retriever/RetrieverFactory.py so that the inner decorator(func) returns func, ensuring decorator chaining and registration work as expected.

[2025-05-30 10:44] Cleanup: Removed temporary diagnostic logging
- Core/Retriever/BaseRetriever.py: Removed logger.critical from _run_personalized_pagerank and reverted logger.error to logger.debug in the first diagnostic block.
- Core/Retriever/EntitiyRetriever.py: Removed logger.critical from _find_relevant_entities_by_ppr.
- Core/AgentTools/entity_tools.py: Removed the diagnostic logger.critical and associated block before calling entity_retriever._find_relevant_entities_by_ppr in entity_ppr_tool.

- Manually provided corrected `relationship_one_hop_neighbors_tool` code to USER after tool call failures. Integrated user's new detailed logging, retained previous fixes (param/attribute access, Pydantic models), and used user's robust graph instance check. Advised manual update, cache clearing, and re-test.

- Core/AgentTools/relationship_tools.py: Updated `relationship_one_hop_neighbors_tool` to access the NetworkX graph via `graph_instance._graph.graph` and adjusted conditional checks accordingly, as per user-provided code.

## Change Log (.model - for Cascade Agent)

### 2025-05-31
- **LiteLLMProvider config compatibility fix**
    - Added `self.temperature` and `self.max_token` to `LiteLLMProvider.__init__`, loading from config.
    - Added `self.max_tokens` as an alias to `self.max_token` for compatibility with agent_brain usage.
    - Set `litellm.drop_params = True` after importing litellm in LiteLLMProvider.py to automatically drop unsupported parameters (like temperature) for O-series models (e.g., o4-mini) and similar, improving compatibility with OpenAI endpoints.
    - Fixes attribute error during plan generation in PlanningAgent when using LiteLLMProvider.
- Replaced the `google_gemini_completion` function in `standalone_litellm_example.py` to:
    - Set both `GEMINI_API_KEY` and `GOOGLE_API_KEY` in the environment for Gemini calls.
    - Pass `api_key` directly to `litellm.completion`.
    - Restore original environment variables after execution.
    - Improves robustness and compatibility with LiteLLM Gemini provider and avoids side effects.
- Updated `LiteLLMProvider.py`:
    - `_achat_completion`, `_achat_completion_stream`, and `async_instructor_completion` now set and restore `GEMINI_API_KEY` and `GOOGLE_API_KEY` environment variables when using Gemini models.
    - Ensures robust Gemini API key handling for all async completions and instructor-based completions.
- **Fix & Validation: `Relationship.OneHopNeighbors` Tool Graph Access**
  - Confirmed that the `relationship_one_hop_neighbors_tool` in `Core/AgentTools/relationship_tools.py` is now functioning correctly within the multi-step orchestrator test plan (`testing/test_agent_orchestrator.py`).
  - The tool successfully accesses the NetworkX graph instance via `graph_instance._graph.graph` as intended.
  - Test logs (`test_orchestrator_log_3step.txt`) show the tool executing without Python errors and correctly returning an empty list of relationships when the input entity IDs were not found in the graph. This verifies the updated graph access mechanism and conditional checks are working as expected.
  - This resolves the primary objective of ensuring the tool's correct integration and behavior regarding graph data access.

- **Test Execution: `test_plan_003_vdb_then_one_hop.json`**
  - Successfully executed the command `python testing/test_agent_orchestrator.py --config Option/Config2.yaml --plan test_plans/test_plan_003_vdb_then_one_hop.json`.
  - Breakthrough: `/tmp/config_attrs_diag.txt` WAS created, confirming the diagnostic block in `test_agent_orchestrator.py` (after `main_config` import) executes and can access config attributes & perform file I/O. 
- However, `stderr` prints (even via captured reference) are still NOT visible in `run_command` output after `main_config`/Loguru init. This points to Loguru's `stderr` handling obscuring direct prints from `run_command`'s capture. 
- Log directory `/home/brian/digimon/default/Logs/` not found, despite `config_attrs_diag.txt` showing `working_dir=./results` and `exp_name=test`. Investigating actual path used by Logger.py.

2025-06-01: Test Script Fixes - COMPLETED
- Modified Files:
1. **testing/test_agent_corpus_to_graph_pipeline.py**
   - Fixed import for `LlamaIndexBaseEmbedding` type hint

     - Fixed embedding initialization to use `main_config.embedding_config`
     - Fixed ChunkFactory initialization to use `main_config.chunk` instead of full config
   - Updated SYSTEM_TASK instructions:

     - Step 3: Changed named outputs to use explicit mapping: `{'vdb_search_results_list': 'similar_entities'}`
     - Step 4: Updated input references to use new named output keys from previous steps
     - Step 4: Added named outputs mapping: `{'final_neighbor_info': 'one_hop_relationships'}`
   - Updated verification logging to check for outputs using correct step IDs and named output keys

### Key Changes Summary:
- Fixed all type hints and imports
- Corrected VDB build_index method call signature
- Updated config and component initialization
- Improved SYSTEM_TASK with explicit output naming mappings
- Enhanced verification logging for better debugging
- Fixed input directory path to use existing test data

- Pipeline executes all 4 steps: corpus preparation, graph building, VDB search, and neighbor retrieval
- Need to investigate why VDB search returns empty results despite successful execution
- Updated SYSTEM_TASK to include proper named outputs mapping for corpus preparation step

2025-06-02: Fixed VDB Building Method Call in test_agent_corpus_to_graph_pipeline.py - COMPLETED
- Changed VDB building from incorrect `build_index_from_documents()` to correct `build_index(elements, meta_data, force=True)`
- Fixed parameters to match BaseIndex.build_index signature: elements (list of dicts) and meta_data (list of metadata keys)
- Used meta_data=["id", "content", "name"] to match entity document structure
- Successfully fixed VDB indexing and registration in shared context - VDB search now returns relevant entities
- VDB search step now returns 5 entities with similarity scores for "causes of the American Revolution" query
- Pipeline VDB functionality fully restored: corpus preparation → graph building → VDB building → VDB search all working

2025-06-02: Fixed Orchestrator Entity ID Extraction for Dictionary Results - COMPLETED
- Added handling for plain dictionary results from VDB search in AgentOrchestrator._resolve_single_input_source
- Now correctly extracts node_id from dict results, falling back to entity_name if node_id not present
- Fixed entity_ids parameter passing from VDB search step to one-hop neighbors step
- Entity IDs are now properly extracted (5 IDs) and passed to relationship tools

2025-06-02: Identified Graph Node ID Mismatch Issue - DISCOVERY
- Found root cause: ERGraph uses entity names as node IDs (e.g., "the american revolution")
- VDB returns UUID-style node_ids (e.g., "93de506c05bf0bc71fa29a19afdc190e") that don't exist in graph
- This mismatch explains why one-hop neighbors returns empty despite correct orchestrator fixes
- Need to either: (1) make VDB return entity names, or (2) update graph to use same UUIDs as VDB

2025-06-02: Fixed One-Hop Neighbors by Prioritizing Entity Names - COMPLETED
- Modified orchestrator to prioritize entity_name extraction over node_id for graph operations
- Since ERGraph uses entity names as node IDs, this ensures proper ID matching
- One-hop neighbors now successfully finds 6 relationships from 5 VDB search results
- Full pipeline now works end-to-end: corpus → graph → VDB → search → neighbors → answer generation
- Agent successfully generates meaningful answers using retrieved graph relationships

2025-06-02: Added Dynamic Custom Ontology Generation for ER Graph
- Created ontology_generator.py with generate_custom_ontology() function
- Modified ERGraph._build_graph() to automatically generate domain-specific ontologies from corpus content
- Enhanced _named_entity_recognition() to include entity type guidance from custom ontology
- Enhanced _openie_post_ner_extract() to include relationship type guidance from custom ontology
- Ontology is generated using LLM based on first few chunks of corpus for context
- Should fix "unknown_relationship" issue by providing domain-specific relationship types

2025-06-02: Fixed Dynamic Custom Ontology Generation and Edge Name Storage
- Found that relationships were being extracted correctly (e.g., "spanned", "occurred in") but not saved
- Issue was enable_edge_name=false in graph config, causing relation_name to be ignored
- Updated test to include enable_edge_name=true in config_overrides
- Improved ontology_generator.py JSON parsing to handle various response formats
- Added debug logging to track ontology generation and relationship extraction
- Should now save meaningful relationship names instead of empty strings

2025-06-02: Fixed One-Hop Neighbors Tool to Return Actual Relationship Names
- Found that relationship_tools.py was looking for 'type' attribute on edges
- Changed edge_attr_for_relation_name from 'type' to 'relation_name' to match ERGraph storage
- One-hop neighbors tool now returns actual relationship names instead of "unknown_relationship"

2025-06-02: GraphVisualizer Tool Implementation
