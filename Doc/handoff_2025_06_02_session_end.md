# DIGIMON Pipeline - Handoff Document - 2025-06-02

## 1. Overall Objective

The primary goal is to debug and stabilize the DIGIMON pipeline for end-to-end execution, particularly using the fictional "Zorathian Empire" corpus. This involves ensuring correct ER graph construction, VDB building and searching, accurate one-hop neighbor retrieval, effective text chunk fetching, and ultimately, the generation of well-grounded, contextually relevant answers based on the corpus content.

## 2. Session Summary & Recent Accomplishments

This session focused on refining the answer generation process and ensuring the pipeline uses all available context (VDB search results, one-hop relationships, and text chunks).

**Key Fixes & Improvements:**

*   **Answer Generation Context:**
    *   Modified `Core/AgentBrain/agent_brain.py` to ensure the final prompt for the LLM includes a comprehensive summary of:
        *   Entities found via VDB search (with similarity scores).
        *   One-hop relationships retrieved from the graph (e.g., "zorathian empire → the crystal plague").
        *   Relevant text chunks (when the plan includes their retrieval).
    *   Updated the LLM system prompt to better guide it in synthesizing answers, prioritizing text content, then relationships, and strictly avoiding external knowledge.
*   **One-Hop Neighbor Data Extraction:**
    *   Fixed an issue in `Core/AgentBrain/agent_brain.py` where the code was looking for `one_hop_relationships` in the step output, while the actual key was `one_hop_neighbors`. The code now checks for both, ensuring relationship data is correctly passed to the LLM.
*   **Example Plan Correction:**
    *   The example plan within `Core/AgentBrain/agent_brain.py` was updated to use the correct tool ID `Relationship.OneHopNeighbors` instead of the previously incorrect `Entity.Onehop`.
*   **Test Validation Enhanced:**
    *   Improved the answer validation logic in `testing/test_fictional_corpus.py`. It now checks for a broader set of keywords (e.g., "crystal", "plague", "aerophantis", "zorthak", "emperor") and provides more nuanced feedback (EXCELLENT for correct cause, GOOD for relevant corpus references).
*   **Fictional Corpus Pipeline Stability:**
    *   The pipeline now generally runs end-to-end for the "Zorathian Empire" corpus. VDB search returns relevant entities, and one-hop neighbor retrieval (when the plan executes it correctly) shows connections like "zorathian empire → the crystal plague".
*   **Git Checkpoint:**
    *   A git commit was made to save the current stable state: `[checkpoint] Stable: DIGIMON pipeline end-to-end for fictional corpus; answer gen uses VDB, one-hop, and text; test improved; field name fallback for one-hop neighbors; see change_log.md for details` (commit `a0ec202`).

## 3. Current Status & Remaining Issues

*   **Answer Grounding**: While answers now reference corpus entities like "fall of Aerophantis," they don't always pinpoint the most crucial information (e.g., "crystal plague" as the direct cause of the empire's fall), even when relationship data linking them is present in the context provided to the LLM.
*   **Inconsistent Plan Generation**: The LLM-generated execution plan is not always consistent. Sometimes it omits the `Chunk.GetTextForEntities` step, or the one-hop neighbor step (`Relationship.OneHopNeighbors`) might not yield results as expected, leading to incomplete context for the final answer.
    *   In one of the recent test runs, the `step_5_onehop` was empty in the final retrieved context, and `step_6_get_text` also returned empty due to an error: `Error in Chunk.GetTextForEntities: Core.AgentSchema.tool_contracts.ChunkGetTextForEntitiesInput() argument after ** must be a mapping, not ChunkGetTextForEntitiesInput`.
*   **Tool Input Error (`Chunk.GetTextForEntities`)**: The error mentioned above for `Chunk.GetTextForEntities` needs investigation. It suggests an issue with how inputs are being passed to this tool, possibly related to Pydantic model instantiation or dictionary unpacking.

## 4. Next Steps & Areas for Investigation

1.  **Investigate `Chunk.GetTextForEntities` Input Error**: Debug the `Core.AgentSchema.tool_contracts.ChunkGetTextForEntitiesInput() argument after ** must be a mapping, not ChunkGetTextForEntitiesInput` error. Check how the orchestrator and `agent_brain.py` prepare and pass inputs to this tool.
2.  **Improve Plan Consistency/Robustness**: 
    *   Analyze why the generated plan sometimes omits crucial steps like text retrieval or why one-hop neighbor retrieval is inconsistent.
    *   Consider refining the planning prompt in `agent_brain.py` to more strongly encourage the inclusion of `Chunk.GetTextForEntities` and ensure `Relationship.OneHopNeighbors` is used effectively.
3.  **Enhance LLM Answer Synthesis from Relationships**: Explore prompt engineering techniques to make the LLM better at inferring direct answers from the relationship data (e.g., explicitly stating that "A is_related_to B" and "B caused_event C" implies A was affected by C).
4.  **Comprehensive Testing**: Conduct more tests with diverse queries against the fictional corpus to identify other potential failure points or areas for improvement in plan generation and answer synthesis.
