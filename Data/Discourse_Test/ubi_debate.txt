Title: The Great Debate on Universal Basic Income

PROPONENTS' NARRATIVE:
Tech billionaire Andrew Yang champions Universal Basic Income (UBI) as "the solution to automation-driven unemployment." He frames it as "investing in human potential" and uses emotional appeals: "No one should lose dignity because a robot took their job."

Economist Dr. Sarah Mitchell supports UBI with data: "Our studies show UBI reduces poverty by 40% without decreasing work participation." She positions critics as "clinging to outdated economic models."

OPPONENTS' COUNTER-NARRATIVE:  
Senator Bob Thompson attacks UBI as "socialist welfare that will bankrupt America." He uses fear-based rhetoric: "Do you want your tax dollars funding laziness?" His framing emphasizes personal responsibility.

Business leader Karen White argues "UBI will destroy work ethic and innovation." She shares anecdotes of "welfare dependency" and warns of "creating a permanent underclass."

RHETORICAL STRATEGIES:
- Proponents use: Future-oriented language, appeals to compassion, economic data
- Opponents use: Traditional values, fear of change, individual responsibility  

DISCOURSE PATTERNS:
1. Competing definitions: "Safety net" vs "Handout"
2. Metaphorical framing: "Foundation for growth" vs "Trap of dependency"  
3. Selective evidence: Both sides cherry-pick studies
4. Identity politics: "Innovators" vs "Hard workers"

The media amplifies polarization. CNN's Jane Foster presents UBI favorably while Fox's Mike Johnson warns of "radical socialism." Social media echo chambers reinforce existing beliefs.
