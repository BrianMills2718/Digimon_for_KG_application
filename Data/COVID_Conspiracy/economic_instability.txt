Have you ever wondered why it's the small businesses that suffered the most during lockdowns, while big corporations thrived? #PandemicEconomics #COVIDConspiracy

Check out the stocks! Big tech companies reaching all-time highs during a global crisis. Isn't that strange? #FollowTheMoney #COVID19

How many small businesses did you see close? How many big corporations? Time to question the imbalance. #CorporateCOVID

Small businesses are the backbone of our economy, but they're the ones getting crushed. Coincidence? I think not. #COVIDUnveiled

Why would a virus be so biased? Favors the big, harms the small. Or is it just our economic system? #COVIDEconomics

There's a pandemic alright, but it's not just the virus. It's the economic disparity it's revealing. #EconomicVirus #COVIDConspiracy

Just a wild thought: Did Amazon and Walmart invent COVID-19 to boost sales? Or is it just a lucky windfall for them? #COVIDCoverUp

Smells like a setup, doesn't it? Big companies are soaring while small businesses are closing. #COVIDDeception

Big tech needs consumers to stay at home, glued to screens. COVID just happens to serve that purpose. #TechTyranny #COVIDQuestions

Pandemic safety or economic coup d'etat? When giants gain while the little guy loses, I begin to wonder. #COVIDCoup

Can we trust those making the rules when they also stand to profit? Time for some real questions. #PandemicProfiteering

In a crisis, we see who profits and who suffers. The divide is too clear to ignore. #CoronavirusCoverUp

Stay at home, they said. It's safer, they said. Safer for whom? #CorporateCorona

While we're in lockdown, the corporate giants are out there gobbling up the market. A bit too convenient, isn't it? #COVIDConvenience

COVID-19: A pandemic or a heist? As corporations grow, it's hard not to wonder. #COVIDHeist

It's a pandemic alright, but the virus isn't the only thing that's contagious. So is corporate greed. #COVIDGreed

The real virus isn't COVID, it's economic disparity. And it seems to be immune to any vaccine. #COVIDDisparity

Big businesses aren't just surviving the pandemic, they're thriving. Seems like a pretty one-sided fight. #COVIDFairFight

As we lockdown and quarantine, the corporate giants are having a field day. A bit too coincidental, isn't it? #COVIDCollusion

Lockdowns seem to do one thing well: transfer wealth from small businesses to corporations. #LockdownLoot

The rich are getting richer, the poor are getting poorer. But hey, it's just a pandemic, right? #COVIDClassWar

It's not just a health crisis, it's an economic one. And guess who's immune? Big corporations. #CorporateCOVID

The real pandemic is economic inequality. COVID-19 is just the vehicle. #COVIDInequality

Is it just a virus, or a clever strategy to reshuffle economic power? #COVIDChessGame

The pandemic narrative is simple: Stay home, stay safe. But what about those who can't afford to? #COVIDNarrative
