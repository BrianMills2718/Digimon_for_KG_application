Crystal Technology of Ancient Xelandra

The ancient civilizations of Xelandra developed sophisticated technologies based on crystalline materials with unique properties. The most notable of these was the Zorathian Empire's mastery of levitite crystals.

Levitite Crystals:
Levitite stones were translucent blue crystals found only in the Shadowpeak Mountains. When properly activated through harmonic resonance at 432 Hz, these crystals generated an anti-gravity field proportional to their mass. A fist-sized levitite crystal could lift approximately 100 kilograms.

The Zorathians discovered that arranging levitite crystals in specific geometric patterns amplified their lifting capacity exponentially. The floating city of Aerophantis used a hexagonal array of 10,000 levitite crystals, each the size of a building, to maintain its position 500 meters above ground.

Energy Transmission:
The empire developed a method of wireless energy transmission using resonant crystal pairs. A "sender crystal" would be energized using solar collectors, and matched "receiver crystals" within a 50-kilometer radius would resonate sympathetically, providing power to various devices.

Crystal Weaponry:
The Sky Warriors of the Zorathian military wielded crystal-based weapons. The most feared was the Prism Lance, which could focus sunlight into a devastating beam capable of melting stone. Defensive shields made from rainbow crystals could deflect these beams by splitting them into harmless colored light.

Agricultural Applications:
Ground Dwellers used growth crystals to enhance crop yields. These green-tinted crystals, when buried in fields, created energy fields that accelerated plant growth by 300%. This technology allowed the empire to support its large population despite limited arable land.

The Crystal Plague:
In 1850 BCE, a mysterious phenomenon began affecting levitite crystals throughout the empire. Infected crystals would develop black veins and gradually lose their anti-gravity properties. Scientists theorized that a form of crystalline virus was responsible, but no cure was ever found. This plague ultimately led to the fall of the Zorathian Empire when their floating cities crashed to earth.
