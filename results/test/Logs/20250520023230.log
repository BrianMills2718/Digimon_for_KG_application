2025-05-20 02:32:45.375 | INFO     | __main__:handle_query_mode:128 - Answer: The American Revolution was fueled by a combination of political, economic, and social factors that ultimately led to the thirteen colonies seeking independence from British rule. One of the primary causes was the issue of taxation without representation imposed by the British Parliament on the colonies. The Stamp Act of 1765 and the Townshend Acts of 1767 were particularly contentious, as they imposed taxes on the colonies without their consent, leading to widespread protests and resistance.

Another significant cause was the erosion of colonial autonomy following the French and Indian War. Prior to this conflict, the colonies had enjoyed a degree of self-governance under the policy of salutary neglect. However, after the war, Britain sought to tighten its control over the colonies, leading to increased tensions and a desire for greater independence among the colonists.

Social factors also played a role in fomenting revolutionary sentiment. The colonists increasingly identified themselves as Americans and developed a sense of unity and shared grievances against British rule. Events such as the Boston Massacre in 1770 and the Boston Tea Party in 1773 further galvanized anti-British sentiment and fueled calls for independence.

Moreover, the ideals of liberty, equality, and self-determination espoused by Enlightenment philosophers like John Locke and Jean-Jacques Rousseau influenced the revolutionary leaders, such as Thomas Jefferson, in their quest for independence. The Declaration of Independence, with its emphasis on natural rights and the consent of the governed, encapsulated these Enlightenment principles and provided a philosophical foundation for the revolution.

In summary, the key causes of the American Revolution can be attributed to issues of taxation without representation, the erosion of colonial autonomy, social unrest, and the influence of Enlightenment ideals on the revolutionary leaders. These factors converged to create a perfect storm of discontent that ultimately culminated in the colonies' declaration of independence and the Revolutionary War against British rule.
