2025-05-20 04:55:46.217 | INFO     | Core.Query.DalkQuery:query:76 - The key causes of the American Revolution were:

1. Taxation Grievances: The British colonists felt unfairly taxed without proper representation in the British Parliament.
   
2. Influence of Enlightenment Ideas: Enlightenment ideas, such as individual rights and self-governance, fueled the independence movement and desire for self-determination among the colonists.

3. Boston Tea Party and Intolerable Acts: The Boston Tea Party, a protest against the British tea tax, led to the British government passing the Intolerable Acts, escalating tensions and resistance.

4. Discontent with British Policies: The Thirteen Colonies were discontent with various British policies that restricted their economic activities and political freedoms, leading to growing resentment and opposition.

5. Taxation Without Representation: The imposition of taxes on the American colonies without providing them with representation in decision-making processes was a significant trigger for the American Revolution.

These factors combined to create a complex situation that ultimately led to the outbreak of the American Revolution.
