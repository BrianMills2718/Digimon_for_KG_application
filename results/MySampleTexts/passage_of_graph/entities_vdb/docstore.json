The colonies also contributed money to the war effort; however, two-fifths of this spending was reimbursed by the British government. Great Britain defeated France and acquired that nation's territory east of the Mississippi River.[28]\n\nIn early 1763, the Bute ministry decided to permanently garrison 10,000 soldiers in North America.[29][30] This would allow approximately 1,500 politically well-connected British Army officers to remain on active duty with full pay (stationing a standing army in Great Britain during peacetime was politically unacceptable).[31] A standing army would provide defense against Native Americans in the west and foreign populations in newly acquired territories (the French in Canada and the Spanish in Florida). In addition, British soldiers could prevent white colonists from instigating conflict with Native Americans and help collect customs duties.[32]\n\nMigration beyond the Appalachian Mountains increased after the French threat was removed, and Native Americans launched Pontiac's War (1763\u20131766) in response. The Grenville ministry issued the Royal Proclamation of 1763, designating the territory between the Appalachian Mountains and the Mississippi River as an Indian Reserve closed to white settlement. The Proclamation failed to stop westward migration while angering settlers, fur traders, and land speculators in the Thirteen Colonies.[33]", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 1599, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "bbab897a-c0bd-460d-a247-1b08ab5975ce": {"__data__": {"id_": "bbab897a-c0bd-460d-a247-1b08ab5975ce", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"entity_name": "chunk-517dd89f19429314e274bd8c27777e5c"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["entity_name"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "0c11675ff80d8a0072f18c3f22562295", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"entity_name": "chunk-517dd89f19429314e274bd8c27777e5c"}, "hash": "837fa180c6a7424e4d2438c053f4a47b0ad76842cd6a8011c0af5c80273969cb", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "chunk-517dd89f19429314e274bd8c27777e5c: The entity chunk-517dd89f19429314e274bd8c27777e5c is associated with the economic and political situation in France during the late 18th century. The economy experienced solid growth, but this growth did not translate into increased tax revenue due to inefficiencies in tax collection. Taxes were mainly burdening the peasants as the nobility and Church enjoyed exemptions. The monarchy funded wars and borrowed heavily, leading to a debt crisis by 1788. Attempts at tax reforms were met with resistance from the nobility and parlements, leading to a national political crisis. The conflict between the Crown and the parlements escalated, with public opinion siding with the parlements. Riots erupted in several towns, prompting the summoning of the Estates-General in 1789. The Parlement of Paris ruled that the Estates-General should convene in the same form as in 1614, sparking debates on representation and voting rights. Liberal nobles and middle-class activists campaigned for increased Third Estate representation and individual voting rights, leading to the formation of the National Assembly. The king eventually agreed to double the representation of the Third Estate, but the issue of vote counting remained unresolved.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 1271, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "03e8b36e-90b0-42b6-b224-db7dc6f8b71b": {"__data__": {"id_": "03e8b36e-90b0-42b6-b224-db7dc6f8b71b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"entity_name": "chunk-541c2fb47007dc4d93603094626a6541"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["entity_name"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "8c48630a73400ca0e3fccd586f5461d0", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"entity_name": "chunk-541c2fb47007dc4d93603094626a6541"}, "hash": "f6e99ce72f1e320177a74b08e335cec8598beedae110fc1e4ca4b12242eb3179", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "chunk-541c2fb47007dc4d93603094626a6541: The entity chunk-541c2fb47007dc4d93603094626a6541 is associated with the historical events leading to the American Revolution. The Thirteen Colonies were established in the 17th century as part of the English Empire, later forming part of the British Empire. The development of a unique American identity can be traced back to events such as the English Civil War and King Philip's War. The colonists fiercely opposed attempts by Charles II and James II to bring New England under direct English control, leading to the nullification of colonial charters. The Glorious Revolution of 1688 and subsequent events, including the 1689 Boston revolt, resulted in the restoration of colonial self-government. The British government implemented mercantilist policies, such as the Navigation Acts, which restricted colonial trade and led to mixed reactions among the colonists. The British government negotiated with colonial leaders and rarely sent military forces to America before 1755, allowing the colonies to become almost completely self-governing. The French and Indian War further shaped the relationship between the colonies and Great Britain.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 1184, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "28281296-867c-4179-9643-bbb5df7efc3f": {"__data__": {"id_": "28281296-867c-4179-9643-bbb5df7efc3f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"entity_name": "chunk-368c7113ca6d5c34ca1cc15cf9e2825a"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["entity_name"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ee9ce931902370278191bb74661190ba", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"entity_name": "chunk-368c7113ca6d5c34ca1cc15cf9e2825a"}, "hash": "96a7512ff06c3b6b35a56dc7a03d35c5caf7b7ee92f6279b90e1501bfcd5f6d8", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "chunk-368c7113ca6d5c34ca1cc15cf9e2825a: The French Revolution (French: R\u00e9volution fran\u00e7aise [\u0281ev\u0254lysj\u0254\u0303 f\u0281\u0251\u0303s\u025b\u02d0z]) was a period of political and societal change in France that began with the Estates General of 1789 and ended with the Coup of 18 Brumaire on 9 November 1799. The revolution was driven by a combination of social, political, and economic factors that the ancien r\u00e9gime (\"old regime\") was unable to manage. It was marked by the convocation of the Estates General, the formation of the National Assembly, the Storming of the Bastille, and the abolition of feudalism, among other radical measures.\n\nThe causes of the French Revolution were rooted in a financial crisis, widespread social distress, and a growing disparity in wealth distribution. The population growth, economic recession, bad harvests, and high unemployment exacerbated the situation. The tax system was complex and inconsistent, leading to resentment among taxpayers. Attempts to reform the system were hindered by regional Parlements, which further fueled the crisis.\n\nKing Louis XVI's indecisiveness in the face of opposition from conservative nobility hindered reform efforts. Enlightenment ideas and events like the American Revolution influenced public discourse on patriotism, liberty, equality, and democracy. Scandals, such as the Affair of the Diamond Necklace, also contributed to public anger towards the court, nobility, and church officials.\n\nThe Revolution led to the establishment of the French First Republic, the Reign of Terror, and the eventual rise of the Directory. The Thermidorian Reaction marked the end of the Reign of Terror, and the Directory was later replaced by the Consulate, with Napoleon Bonaparte as First Consul.

It culminated in the American Revolutionary War, which began on April 19, 1775, with the Battles of Lexington and Concord. Initially seeking incremental autonomy, colonial separatist leaders embraced full independence as the war progressed. The Second Continental Congress, meeting in Philadelphia, appointed George Washington as commander-in-chief of the Continental Army in 1775 and unanimously adopted the Declaration of Independence in 1776. The war's outcome was uncertain until a decisive victory at the Siege of Yorktown in 1781 led to the Treaty of Paris in 1783, recognizing the independence of the United States.\n\nDiscontent with colonial rule arose after the French and Indian War in 1763, with tensions escalating due to new taxes and British control over western lands. Events like the Stamp Act Congress, Townshend Acts, Boston Massacre, Gaspee incident, and Boston Tea Party fueled the revolutionary cause. The First Continental Congress in 1774 and the subsequent Battles of Lexington and Concord marked the beginning of coordinated resistance.
