## Detailed Implementation Plan

### Week 1: Async Foundation
```python
# Day 1-2: Base async orchestrator
class AsyncOrchestrator:
    async def process_query_stream(self, query: str):
        async for update in self._execute_plan_stream(query):
            yield update

# Day 3-4: Tool interface update
class AsyncTool(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    async def execute_async(self, input_data: Any) -> AsyncGenerator:
        pass

# Day 5: Integration and testing
```

### Week 2: Tool Registry and Memory
```python
# Day 1-2: Dynamic tool registry
class DynamicToolRegistry:
    def register_tool(self, tool: AsyncTool):
        self.tools[tool.name] = tool
        self._categorize_tool(tool)

# Day 3-5: Memory system
class GraphRAGMemory:
    async def learn_pattern(self, pattern: ExecutionPattern):
        await self.pattern_store.add(pattern)
```

### Week 3-4: Performance and Evaluation
```python
# Performance optimization
class CacheManager:
    def __init__(self):
        self.embedding_cache = TTLCache(maxsize=10000, ttl=3600)
        self.result_cache = TTLCache(maxsize=1000, ttl=1800)

# Evaluation framework
class QualityEvaluator:
    async def evaluate(self, query, answer, context):
        scores = await asyncio.gather(
            self.faithfulness_score(answer, context),
            self.relevance_score(query, answer),
            self.completeness_score(query, answer, context)
        )
        return QualityScore(scores)
```

### Week 5-6: Multi-Agent System
```python
# Specialized agents
class EntityDiscoveryAgent(BaseAgent):
    def __init__(self):
        self.tools = [EntityVDBSearch(), EntityPPR()]
        self.specialization = "entity_discovery"

# Agent coordination
class AgentTeam:
    async def coordinate_agents(self, query: str):
        # Orchestrate specialized agents
        pass
```

### Week 7-8: Integration and Production
```python
# WebSocket streaming
class StreamingAPI:
    async def handle_query(self, websocket, query):
        async for update in orchestrator.process_query_stream(query):
            await websocket.send_json(update)

# Production monitoring
class ProductionMonitor:
    def track_metrics(self):
        # Latency, throughput, quality metrics
        pass
```

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Test Structure
```python
# tests/unit/test_async_orchestrator.py
async def test_async_execution():
    orchestrator = AsyncOrchestrator()
    updates = []
    async for update in orchestrator.process_query_stream("test query"):
        updates.append(update)
    assert len(updates) > 0
    assert all(u["type"] in ["progress", "result"] for u in updates)
```

### Integration Test Structure
```python
# tests/integration/test_streaming_system.py
async def test_end_to_end_streaming():
    # Full system test with streaming
    pass
```

### Performance Test Structure
```python
# tests/performance/test_query_latency.py
async def test_concurrent_queries():
    queries = ["query1", "query2", "query3"] * 10
    start = time.time()
    results = await asyncio.gather(*[
        process_query(q) for q in queries
    ])
    elapsed = time.time() - start
    assert elapsed < 30  # All queries in <30s
```

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
1. **Async complexity**: Start simple, add complexity gradually
2. **Memory overhead**: Implement memory limits and cleanup
3. **Performance regression**: Continuous benchmarking
4. **Integration issues**: Extensive integration testing

### Mitigation Strategies
- Feature flags for gradual rollout
- Fallback to synchronous execution if needed
- Comprehensive error handling
- Performance budgets with automatic alerts

## Success Criteria

### Checkpoint Completion
- [ ] All tests passing
- [ ] Performance targets met
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Code reviewed and merged

### Overall Success
- [ ] 5-10s average query latency
