# Discourse Analysis Demonstration Plan

## Overview
This plan demonstrates DIGIMON's capability to perform sophisticated discourse analysis on COVID-19 conspiracy theories by answering 5 policy-relevant questions. Each question exercises different aspects of the discourse analysis framework (Who/Says What/To Whom/In What Setting/With What Effect).

## 5 Policy Analyst Questions

### Question 1: Influence Networks and Key Actors
**"Who are the super-spreaders of COVID conspiracy theories, what are their network characteristics, and how do they coordinate to amplify misinformation?"**
- Focus: WHO interrogative
- Policy Relevance: Identify key nodes for targeted intervention

### Question 2: Narrative Evolution and Mutation
**"How do conspiracy narratives evolve and mutate as they spread through social networks, and what linguistic markers indicate narrative transformation?"**
- Focus: SAYS WHAT interrogative
- Policy Relevance: Understand how misinformation adapts to evade detection

### Question 3: Community Vulnerability and Polarization
**"Which communities are most susceptible to conspiracy theories, what are their demographic and psychographic characteristics, and how does exposure lead to polarization?"**
- Focus: TO WHOM interrogative
- Policy Relevance: Identify vulnerable populations for protection

### Question 4: Platform Features and Spread Mechanisms
**"What platform features (hashtags, retweets, algorithms) most effectively facilitate conspiracy theory spread, and how do different platforms compare?"**
- Focus: IN WHAT SETTING interrogative
- Policy Relevance: Inform platform regulation and design

### Question 5: Intervention Effectiveness
**"What are the measurable effects of different counter-narrative strategies, and which interventions most effectively reduce conspiracy belief and spread?"**
- Focus: WITH WHAT EFFECT interrogative
- Policy Relevance: Evidence-based intervention design

## Test Framework

### Unit Tests
```python
# Test discourse prompt generation
def test_discourse_prompts():
    assert len(INTERROGATIVE_PROMPTS) == 5
    assert "WHO" in INTERROGATIVE_PROMPTS
    
# Test mini-ontology generation
def test_mini_ontology():
    ontology = planner.generate_mini_ontology("Who")
    assert "entities" in ontology
    assert "User" in ontology["entities"]
    
# Test retrieval chain generation
def test_retrieval_chain():
    chain = planner.generate_retrieval_chain("influence_network")
    assert len(chain) > 0
    assert chain[0]["operator"] in ["by_ppr", "by_vdb"]
```

### Integration Tests
```python
# Test end-to-end question analysis
async def test_question_analysis():
    result = await executor.analyze_policy_question(
        "Who are the super-spreaders?",
        dataset_path="covid_tweets.csv"
    )
    assert "insights" in result
    assert len(result["insights"]) > 0
    assert "super_spreaders" in result
```

### Validation Tests
```python
# Test accuracy against ground truth
def test_accuracy():
    predicted = executor.identify_influencers()
    ground_truth = load_ground_truth()
    precision = calculate_precision(predicted, ground_truth)
    assert precision > 0.85
