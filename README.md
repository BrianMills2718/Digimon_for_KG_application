### About this Fork: DIGIMON

This fork, **DIGIMON (Deep Analysis of Graph-Based Retrieval-Augmented Generation Systems)**, significantly refactors and extends the original project. The primary motivation is to transform the initial monolithic testing pipeline into a highly modular and flexible "usage suite." This allows for deeper analysis, more adaptable experimentation, and provides a robust foundation for advanced research into graph-based RAG.

Key enhancements in this fork include:
* **Decoupled Operational Modes:** You can now separately format documents, build Knowledge Graphs (KGs) and their associated vector databases, query these artifacts, and evaluate the results.
* **Focus on Granular Operators:** The system exposes approximately 16 underlying retrieval and graph manipulation operators, paving the way for dynamic composition of RAG strategies.
* **Intelligent Agent Development:** A major goal of this fork is the development of an LLM-based intelligent agent capable of autonomously structuring KGs and dynamically determining optimal retrieval chains by leveraging these granular operators.

## Current Features & Capabilities

### Decoupled Architecture

This fork features a modular design with three distinct operational modes, manageable via `main.py`:

1.  **Build Mode**: Constructs the knowledge graph and generates all necessary artifacts (e.g., graph structure, vector databases for entities/relations, community reports).
    ```bash
    python main.py build -opt Option/Method/RAPTOR.yaml -dataset_name your_dataset
    ```
2.  **Query Mode**: Loads pre-built artifacts to efficiently answer questions using a specified RAG method or operator chain.
    ```bash
    python main.py query -opt Option/Method/RAPTOR.yaml -dataset_name your_dataset -question "Your question here?"
    ```
3.  **Evaluate Mode**: Assesses the performance of different methods against benchmark datasets and questions.
    ```bash
    python main.py evaluate -opt Option/Method/RAPTOR.yaml -dataset_name your_dataset
    ```

### Web Interface (API & UI)

This fork also includes a Flask API server and an initial React UI for a user-friendly experience (Note: current development focus is more on backend agent capabilities):

#### Start the Flask API Server
```bash
# From the repository root
python api.py
This starts the server (default: http://localhost:5000), providing endpoints for /api/query, /api/build, and /api/evaluate.

Start the React UI
Bash

# From the repository root (if UI files are at root, or adjust path)
# cd graphrag-react-ui # If UI is in a subdirectory
npm install   # Only needed first time
npm start
Access the UI (default: http://localhost:3000).

Available Methods (Pre-defined Configurations)
The following pre-defined RAG method configurations have been verified to work with the decoupled build, query, and (for many) evaluate modes. These methods are compositions of the underlying granular operators.

Dalk (Entity-Relation graph)
GR (G-Retriever, Entity-Relation graph)
LGraphRAG (Local search in GraphRAG, uses RKG with communities)
GGraphRAG (Global search in GraphRAG, uses RKG with communities)
HippoRAG (Entity-Relation graph)
KGP (Passage graph)
LightRAG (Rich knowledge graph)
RAPTOR (Tree graph)
ToG (Think-on-Graph, Entity-Relation graph)
Intelligent Agent Framework (Under Development)
A core focus of this fork is building an intelligent agent that can dynamically compose RAG strategies.

Operator-Level Modularity: The agent will leverage the ~16 granular operators (detailed below) as its building blocks or "tools."
Pydantic-based Execution Plans: The agent's reasoning will result in a structured "Execution Plan" (defined using Pydantic models) that specifies the sequence of operators and their configurations.
Agent Orchestrator: A backend component is being developed to interpret these plans and execute the tool chain.
Current Tool Progress: The Entity.VDBSearch tool has been successfully implemented and tested end-to-end, including VDB persistence and loading.
Quick Start üöÄ
From Source
Bash

# Clone this repository
git clone [https://github.com/BrianMills2718/Digimon_KG.git](https://github.com/BrianMills2718/Digimon_KG.git) # Ensure this is your repo URL
cd Digimon_KG
Install Dependencies
Ensure you have the required dependencies installed. The primary environment is defined in experiment.yml.

Bash

conda env create -f experiment.yml -n digimon
conda activate digimon
(Note: environment.yml may also be present; experiment.yml is referenced in the original quick start).

API Keys and Configuration
Copy Option/Config2.example.yaml to Option/Config2.yaml.
Edit Option/Config2.yaml to include your API keys (e.g., OpenAI) and set desired default models.
Method-specific configurations are in Option/Method/.
Supported LLM Backends
DIGIMON supports both cloud-based and local deployment of LLMs via Option/Config2.yaml:

Cloud-based models: OpenAI (e.g., gpt-4, gpt-3.5-turbo)
Locally deployed models: Ollama and LlamaFactory compatible endpoints.
To use a local model, set api_type to open_llm in Option/Config2.yaml and provide your local model's base_url and model name.

Example Option/Config2.yaml snippet for LLM:
YAML

llm:
  # For OpenAI
  api_type: "openai"
  model: "gpt-3.5-turbo"
  # api_key: "YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY" # Can also be set as an environment variable

  # For Ollama or other LlamaFactory-compatible local LLMs
  # api_type: "open_llm"
  # model: "YOUR_LOCAL_MODEL_NAME" # e.g., "llama3"
  # base_url: "http://localhost:11434/v1" # Default for Ollama OpenAI-compatible API
  # api_key: "unused" # Typically not required for local models

Graph Types
(This section from the original README is excellent and relevant ‚Äì keeping it as is)

Based on the entity and relation, we categorize the graph into the following types:

Chunk Tree: A tree structure formed by document content and summary.
Passage Graph: A relational network composed of passages, tables, and other elements within documents.
KG: knowledge graph (KG) is constructed by extracting entities and relationships from each chunk, which contains only entities and relations, is commonly represented as triples.
TKG: A textual knowledge graph (TKG) is a specialized KG (following the same construction step as KG), which enriches entities with detailed descriptions and type information.
RKG: A rich knowledge graph (RKG), which further incorporates keywords associated with relations.
The criteria for the classification of graph types are as follows:

Graph Attributes	Chunk Tree	Passage Graph	KG	TKG	RKG
Original Content	‚úÖ	‚úÖ	‚ùå	‚ùå	‚ùå
Entity Name	‚ùå	‚ùå	‚úÖ	‚úÖ	‚úÖ
Entity Type	‚ùå	‚ùå	‚ùå	‚úÖ	‚úÖ
Entity Description	‚ùå	‚ùå	‚ùå	‚úÖ	‚úÖ
Relation Name	‚ùå	‚ùå	‚úÖ	‚ùå	‚úÖ
Relation keyword	‚ùå	‚ùå	‚ùå	‚ùå	‚úÖ
Relation Description	‚ùå	‚ùå	‚ùå	‚úÖ	‚úÖ

Operators in the Retrieve Stage (Building Blocks for the DIGIMON Agent)
The retrieval stage lies the key role ‚ÄºÔ∏è in the entire GraphRAG process. ‚ú® The goal is to identify query-relevant content that supports the generation phase, enabling the LLM to provide more accurate responses.

üí°üí°üí° After thoroughly reviewing all implementations, we've distilled them into a set of 16 operators üß©üß©. Each pre-defined method constructs its retrieval module by combining one or more of these operators. The DIGIMON agent will dynamically chain these operators to create novel and optimized RAG strategies.

Five Types of Operators
We classify the operators into five categories, each offering a different way to retrieve and structure relevant information from graph-based data.

‚≠ïÔ∏è Entity Operators
Retrieve entities (e.g., people, places, organizations) that are most relevant to the given query.

VDB	Select top-k nodes from the vector database	G-retriever, RAPTOR, KGP
RelNode	Extract nodes from given relationships	LightRAG
PPR	Run PPR on the graph, return top-k nodes with PPR scores	FastGraphRAG
Agent	Utilizes LLM to find the useful entities	ToG
Onehop	Selects the one-hop neighbor entities of the given entities	LightRAG

FromRel	Return chunks containing given relationships	LightRAG
Occurrence	Rank top-k chunks based on occurrence of both entities in relationships	Local Search for MS GraphRAG

üîó Community Operators
Identify high-level information, which is only used for MS GraphRAG.
