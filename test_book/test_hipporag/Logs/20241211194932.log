You\nwill, therefore, permit me to repeat, emphatically, that Marley was as\ndead as a door-nail.\n\nScrooge knew he was dead? Of course he did. How could it be otherwise?\nScrooge and he were partners for I don\'t know how many years. Scrooge\nwas his sole executor, his sole administrator, his sole assign, his sole\nresiduary legatee, his sole friend, and sole mourner. And even Scrooge\nwas not so dreadfully cut up by the sad event but that he was an\nexcellent man of business on the very day of the funeral, and solemnised\nit with an undoubted bargain.\n\nThe mention of Marley\'s funeral brings me back to the point I started\nfrom. There is no doubt that Marley was dead. This must be distinctly\nunderstood, or nothing wonderful can come of the story I am going to\nrelate. If we were not perfectly convinced that Hamlet\'s father died\nbefore the play began, there would be nothing more remarkable in his\ntaking a stroll at night, in an easterly wind, upon his own ramparts,\nthan there would be in any other middle-aged gentleman rashly turning\nout after dark in a breezy spot--say St. Paul\'s Churchyard, for\ninstance--literally to astonish his son\'s weak mind.\n\nScrooge never painted out Old Marley\'s name. There it stood, years\nafterwards, above the warehouse door: Scrooge and Marley. The firm was\nknown as Scrooge and Marley. Sometimes people new to the business called\nScrooge Scrooge, and sometimes Marley, but he answered to both names. It\nwas all the same to him.\n\nOh! but he was a tight-fisted hand at the grindstone, Scrooge! a\nsqueezing, wrenching, grasping, scraping, clutching, covetous old\nsinner! Hard and sharp as flint, from which no steel had ever struck out\ngenerous fire; secret, and self-contained, and solitary as an oyster.\nThe cold within him froze his old features, nipped his pointed nose,\nshrivelled his cheek, stiffened his gait; made his eyes red, his thin\nlips blue; and spoke out shrewdly in his grating voice. A frosty rime\nwas on his head, and on his eyebrows, and his wiry chin. He carried his\nown low temperature always about with him; he iced his office in the\ndog-days, and didn\'t thaw it one degree at Christmas.\n\nExternal heat and cold had little influence on Scrooge. No warmth could\nwarm, no wintry weather chill him. No wind that blew was bitterer than\nhe, no falling snow was more intent upon its purpose, no pelting rain\nless open to entreaty. Foul weather didn\'t know where to have him. The\nheaviest rain, and snow, and hail, and sleet could boast of the\nadvantage over him in only one respect. They often \'came down\'\nhandsomely, and Scrooge never did.\n\nNobody ever stopped him in the street to say, with gladsome looks, \'My\ndear Scrooge, how are you? When will you come to see me?\' No beggars\nimplored him to bestow a trifle, no children asked him what it was\no\'clock, no man or woman ever once in all his life inquired the way to\nsuch and such a place, of Scrooge. Even the blind men\'s dogs appeared to\nknow him; and, when they saw him coming on, would tug their owners into\ndoorways and up courts; and then would wag their tails as though they\nsaid, \'No eye at all is better than an evil eye, dark master!\'\n\nBut what did Scrooge care? It was the very thing he liked. To edge his\nway along the crowded paths of life, warning all human sympathy to keep\nits distance, was what the knowing ones call \'nuts\' to Scrooge.\n\nOnce upon a time--of all the good days in the year, on Christmas\nEve--old Scrooge sat busy in his counting-house. It was cold, bleak,\nbiting weather; foggy withal; and he could hear the people in the court\noutside go wheezing up and down, beating their hands upon their breasts,\nand stamping their feet upon the pavement stones to warm them.

It was cold, bleak,\nbiting weather; foggy withal; and he could hear the people in the court\noutside go wheezing up and down, beating their hands upon their breasts,\nand stamping their feet upon the pavement stones to warm them. The City\nclocks had only just gone three, but it was quite dark already--it had\nnot been light all day--and candles were flaring in the windows of the\nneighbouring offices, like ruddy smears upon the palpable brown air. The\nfog came pouring in at every chink and keyhole, and was so dense\nwithout, that, although the court was of the narrowest, the houses\nopposite were mere phantoms. To see the dingy cloud come drooping down,\nobscuring everything, one might have thought that nature lived hard by,\nand was brewing on a large scale.\n\nThe door of Scrooge\'s counting-house was open, that he might keep his\neye upon his clerk, who in a dismal little cell beyond, a sort of tank,\nwas copying letters. Scrooge had a very small fire, but the clerk\'s fire\nwas so very much smaller that it looked like one coal. But he couldn\'t\nreplenish it, for Scrooge kept the coal-box in his own room; and so\nsurely as the clerk came in with the shovel, the master predicted that\nit would be necessary for them to part. Wherefore the clerk put on his\nwhite comforter, and tried to warm himself at the candle; in which\neffort, not being a man of strong imagination, he failed.\n\n\'A merry Christmas, uncle!

It was\nthe voice of Scrooge\'s nephew, who came upon him so quickly that this\nwas the first intimation he had of his approach.\n\n\'Bah!\' said Scrooge. \'Humbug!\'\n\nHe had so heated himself with rapid walking in the fog and frost, this\nnephew of Scrooge\'s, that he was all in a glow; his face was ruddy and\nhandsome; his eyes sparkled, and his breath smoked again.\n\n\'Christmas a humbug, uncle!\' said Scrooge\'s nephew. \'You don\'t mean\nthat, I am sure?\'\n\n\'I do,\' said Scrooge. \'Merry Christmas! What right have you to be merry?\nWhat reason have you to be merry? You\'re poor enough.\'\n\n\'Come, then,\' returned the nephew gaily. \'What right have you to be\ndismal? What reason have you to be morose? You\'re rich enough.\'\n\nScrooge, having no better answer ready on the spur of the moment, said,\n\'Bah!\' again; and followed it up with \'Humbug!\'\n\n\'Don\'t be cross, uncle!\' said the nephew.\n\n\'What else can I be,\' returned the uncle, \'when I live in such a world\nof fools as this? Merry Christmas! Out upon merry Christmas! What\'s\nChristmas-time to you but a time for paying bills without money; a time\nfor finding yourself a year older, and not an hour richer; a time for\nbalancing your books, and having every item in \'em through a round dozen\nof months presented dead against you? If I could work my will,\' said\nScrooge indignantly, \'every idiot who goes about with "Merry Christmas"\non his lips should be boiled with his own pudding, and buried with a\nstake of holly through his heart. He should!\'\n\n\'Uncle!\' pleaded the nephew.\n\n\'Nephew!\' returned the uncle sternly, \'keep Christmas in your own way,\nand let me keep it in mine.\'\n\n\'Keep it!\' repeated Scrooge\'s nephew. \'But you don\'t keep it.\'\n\n\'Let me leave it alone, then,\' said Scrooge. \'Much good may it do you!\nMuch good it has ever done you!\'\n\n\'There are many things from which I might have derived good, by which I\nhave not profited, I dare say,\' returned the nephew; \'Christmas among\nthe rest. But I am sure I have always thought of Christmas-time, when\nit has come round--apart from the veneration due to its sacred name and\norigin, if anything belonging to it can be apart from that--as a good\ntime; a kind, forgiving, charitable, pleasant time; the only time I know\nof, in the long calendar of the year, when men and women seem by one\nconsent to open their shut-up hearts freely, and to think of people\nbelow them as if they really were fellow-passengers to the grave,\n######################\nOutput:\n'}]

Piercing, searching, biting cold. If the good\nSt. Dunstan had but nipped the Evil Spirit\'s nose with a touch of such\nweather as that, instead of using his familiar weapons, then indeed he\nwould have roared to lusty purpose. The owner of one scant young nose,\ngnawed and mumbled by the hungry cold as bones are gnawed by dogs,\nstooped down at Scrooge\'s keyhole to regale him with a Christmas carol;\nbut, at the first sound of\n\n  \'God bless you, merry gentleman,\n  May nothing you dismay!\'\n\nScrooge seized the ruler with such energy of action that the singer fled\nin terror, leaving the keyhole to the fog, and even more congenial\nfrost.\n\nAt length the hour of shutting up the counting-house arrived. With an\nill-will Scrooge dismounted from his stool, and tacitly admitted the\nfact to the expectant clerk in the tank, who instantly snuffed his\ncandle out, and put on his hat.\n\n\'You\'ll want all day to-morrow, I suppose?\' said Scrooge.\n\n\'If quite convenient, sir.\'\n\n\'It\'s not convenient,\' said Scrooge, \'and it\'s not fair.

He lived in chambers which had\nonce belonged to his deceased partner. They were a gloomy suite of\nrooms, in a lowering pile of building up a yard, where it had so little\nbusiness to be, that one could scarcely help fancying it must have run\nthere when it was a young house, playing at hide-and-seek with other\nhouses, and have forgotten the way out again. It was old enough now, and\ndreary enough; for nobody lived in it but Scrooge, the other rooms\nbeing all let out as offices. The yard was so dark that even Scrooge,\nwho knew its every stone, was fain to grope with his hands.

It was not in impenetrable shadow, as the other objects\nin the yard were, but had a dismal light about it, like a bad lobster in\na dark cellar. It was not angry or ferocious, but looked at Scrooge as\nMarley used to look; with ghostly spectacles turned up on its ghostly\nforehead. The hair was curiously stirred, as if by breath or hot air;\nand, though the eyes were wide open, they were perfectly motionless.\nThat, and its livid colour, made it horrible; but its horror seemed to\nbe in spite of the face, and beyond its control, rather than a part of\nits own expression.\n\nAs Scrooge looked fixedly at this phenomenon, it was a knocker again.\n\nTo say that he was not startled, or that his blood was not conscious of\na terrible sensation to which it had been a stranger from infancy, would\nbe untrue. But he put his hand upon the key he had relinquished, turned\nit sturdily, walked in, and lighted his candle.\n\nHe _did_ pause, with a moment\'s irresolution, before he shut the door;\nand he _did_ look cautiously behind it first, as if he half expected to\nbe terrified with the sight of Marley\'s pigtail sticking out into the\nhall. But there was nothing on the back of the door, except the screws\nand nuts that held the knocker on, so he said, \'Pooh, pooh!\' and closed\nit with a bang.\n\nThe sound resounded through the house like thunder. Every room above,\nand every cask in the wine-merchant\'s cellars below, appeared to have a\nseparate peal of echoes of its own. Scrooge was not a man to be\nfrightened by echoes. He fastened the door, and walked across the hall,\nand up the stairs: slowly, too: trimming his candle as he went.\n\nYou may talk vaguely about driving a coach and six up a good old flight\nof stairs, or through a bad young Act of Parliament; but I mean to say\nyou might have got a hearse up that staircase, and taken it broadwise,\nwith the splinter-bar towards the wall, and the door towards the\nbalustrades: and done it easy. There was plenty of width for that, and\nroom to spare; which is perhaps the reason why Scrooge thought he saw a\nlocomotive hearse going on before him in the gloom. Half-a-dozen\ngas-lamps out of the street wouldn\'t have lighted the entry too well, so\nyou may suppose that it was pretty dark with Scrooge\'s dip.\n\nUp Scrooge went, not caring a button for that. Darkness is cheap, and\nScrooge liked it. But, before he shut his heavy door, he walked through\nhis rooms to see that all was right. He had just enough recollection of\nthe face to desire to do that.\n\nSitting-room, bedroom, lumber-room. All as they should be. Nobody under\nthe table, nobody under the sofa; a small fire in the grate; spoon and\nbasin ready; and the little saucepan of gruel (Scrooge had a cold in his\nhead) upon the hob. Nobody under the bed; nobody in the closet; nobody\nin his dressing-gown, which was hanging up in a suspicious attitude\nagainst the wall. Lumber-room as usual. Old fire-guard, old shoes, two\nfish baskets, washing-stand on three legs, and a poker.\n\n[Illustration: _Nobody under the bed; nobody in the closet; nobody in\nhis dressing-gown, which was hanging up in a suspicious attitude against\nthe wall_]\n\nQuite satisfied, he closed his door, and locked himself in; double\nlocked himself in, which was not his custom. Thus secured against\nsurprise, he took off his cravat; put on his dressing-gown and slippers,\nand his nightcap; and sat down before the fire to take his gruel.\n\nIt was a very low fire indeed; nothing on such a bitter night. He was\nobliged to sit close to it, and brood\n######################\nOutput:\n'}]

You\nwill, therefore, permit me to repeat, emphatically, that Marley was as\ndead as a door-nail.\n\nScrooge knew he was dead? Of course he did. How could it be otherwise?\nScrooge and he were partners for I don\'t know how many years. Scrooge\nwas his sole executor, his sole administrator, his sole assign, his sole\nresiduary legatee, his sole friend, and sole mourner. And even Scrooge\nwas not so dreadfully cut up by the sad event but that he was an\nexcellent man of business on the very day of the funeral, and solemnised\nit with an undoubted bargain.\n\nThe mention of Marley\'s funeral brings me back to the point I started\nfrom. There is no doubt that Marley was dead. This must be distinctly\nunderstood, or nothing wonderful can come of the story I am going to\nrelate. If we were not perfectly convinced that Hamlet\'s father died\nbefore the play began, there would be nothing more remarkable in his\ntaking a stroll at night, in an easterly wind, upon his own ramparts,\nthan there would be in any other middle-aged gentleman rashly turning\nout after dark in a breezy spot--say St. Paul\'s Churchyard, for\ninstance--literally to astonish his son\'s weak mind.\n\nScrooge never painted out Old Marley\'s name. There it stood, years\nafterwards, above the warehouse door: Scrooge and Marley. The firm was\nknown as Scrooge and Marley. Sometimes people new to the business called\nScrooge Scrooge, and sometimes Marley, but he answered to both names. It\nwas all the same to him.\n\nOh! but he was a tight-fisted hand at the grindstone, Scrooge! a\nsqueezing, wrenching, grasping, scraping, clutching, covetous old\nsinner! Hard and sharp as flint, from which no steel had ever struck out\ngenerous fire; secret, and self-contained, and solitary as an oyster.\nThe cold within him froze his old features, nipped his pointed nose,\nshrivelled his cheek, stiffened his gait; made his eyes red, his thin\nlips blue; and spoke out shrewdly in his grating voice. A frosty rime\nwas on his head, and on his eyebrows, and his wiry chin. He carried his\nown low temperature always about with him; he iced his office in the\ndog-days, and didn\'t thaw it one degree at Christmas.\n\nExternal heat and cold had little influence on Scrooge. No warmth could\nwarm, no wintry weather chill him. No wind that blew was bitterer than\nhe, no falling snow was more intent upon its purpose, no pelting rain\nless open to entreaty. Foul weather didn\'t know where to have him. The\nheaviest rain, and snow, and hail, and sleet could boast of the\nadvantage over him in only one respect. They often \'came down\'\nhandsomely, and Scrooge never did.\n\nNobody ever stopped him in the street to say, with gladsome looks, \'My\ndear Scrooge, how are you? When will you come to see me?\' No beggars\nimplored him to bestow a trifle, no children asked him what it was\no\'clock, no man or woman ever once in all his life inquired the way to\nsuch and such a place, of Scrooge. Even the blind men\'s dogs appeared to\nknow him; and, when they saw him coming on, would tug their owners into\ndoorways and up courts; and then would wag their tails as though they\nsaid, \'No eye at all is better than an evil eye, dark master!\'\n\nBut what did Scrooge care? It was the very thing he liked. To edge his\nway along the crowded paths of life, warning all human sympathy to keep\nits distance, was what the knowing ones call \'nuts\' to Scrooge.\n\nOnce upon a time--of all the good days in the year, on Christmas\nEve--old Scrooge sat busy in his counting-house. It was cold, bleak,\nbiting weather; foggy withal; and he could hear the people in the court\noutside go wheezing up and down, beating their hands upon their breasts,\nand stamping their feet upon the pavement stones to warm them. The City\nclocks had only just gone three, but it was quite dark already--it had\nnot been light all day--and candles were flaring in the windows of\n######################\nOutput:\n\n: Based on the provided text and entity types, here is the output:\n\n("entity"<|>"Scrooge"<|>"person"<|>"Scrooge is a character who is described as being tight-fisted, cold, and solitary, with a reputation for being unfriendly and unapproachable.")##\n("entity"<|>"Marley"<|>"person"<|>"Marley is a character who is described as being dead, with Scrooge being his sole executor, administrator, and assign.")##\n("entity"<|>"Scrooge and Marley"<|>"organization"<|>"Scrooge and Marley is a firm that is known for being tight-fisted and unfriendly.")##\n("relationship"<|>"Scrooge"<|>"Marley"<|>"Scrooge is the executor, administrator, and assign of Marley\'s estate, indicating a close relationship between the two characters."<|>"executorship, administration"<|>9)##\n("relationship"<|>"Scrooge"<|>"Scrooge and Marley"<|>"Scrooge is a partner in the firm of Scrooge and Marley, indicating a professional relationship."<|>"partnership, business"<|>8)##\n("content_keywords"<|>"tight-fisted, cold, solitary, unfriendly, executorship, partnership")<|COMPLETE|>\n\nNote that the output only includes entities and relationships that are explicitly mentioned in the text, and does not include any inferences or implied relationships.\n: MANY entities were missed in the last extraction.

Let it also be borne\nin mind that Scrooge had not bestowed one thought on Marley since his\nlast mention of his seven-years\'-dead partner that afternoon. And then\nlet any man explain to me, if he can, how it happened that Scrooge,\nhaving his key in the lock of the door, saw in the knocker, without its\nundergoing any intermediate process of change--not a knocker, but\nMarley\'s face.\n\nMarley\'s face. It was not in impenetrable shadow, as the other objects\nin the yard were, but had a dismal light about it, like a bad lobster in\na dark cellar. It was not angry or ferocious, but looked at Scrooge as\nMarley used to look; with ghostly spectacles turned up on its ghostly\nforehead. The hair was curiously stirred, as if by breath or hot air;\nand, though the eyes were wide open, they were perfectly motionless.\nThat, and its livid colour, made it horrible; but its horror seemed to\nbe in spite of the face, and beyond its control, rather than a part of\nits own expression.\n\nAs Scrooge looked fixedly at this phenomenon, it was a knocker again.\n\nTo say that he was not startled, or that his blood was not conscious of\na terrible sensation to which it had been a stranger from infancy, would\nbe untrue. But he put his hand upon the key he had relinquished, turned\nit sturdily, walked in, and lighted his candle.\n\nHe _did_ pause, with a moment\'s irresolution, before he shut the door;\nand he _did_ look cautiously behind it first, as if he half expected to\nbe terrified with the sight of Marley\'s pigtail sticking out into the\nhall. But there was nothing on the back of the door, except the screws\nand nuts that held the knocker on, so he said, \'Pooh, pooh!\' and closed\nit with a bang.\n\nThe sound resounded through the house like thunder. Every room above,\nand every cask in the wine-merchant\'s cellars below, appeared to have a\nseparate peal of echoes of its own. Scrooge was not a man to be\nfrightened by echoes. He fastened the door, and walked across the hall,\nand up the stairs: slowly, too: trimming his candle as he went.\n\nYou may talk vaguely about driving a coach and six up a good old flight\nof stairs, or through a bad young Act of Parliament; but I mean to say\nyou might have got a hearse up that staircase, and taken it broadwise,\nwith the splinter-bar towards the wall, and the door towards the\nbalustrades: and done it easy. There was plenty of width for that, and\nroom to spare; which is perhaps the reason why Scrooge thought he saw a\nlocomotive hearse going on before him in the gloom. Half-a-dozen\ngas-lamps out of the street wouldn\'t have lighted the entry too well, so\nyou may suppose that it was pretty dark with Scrooge\'s dip.\n\nUp Scrooge went, not caring a button for that. Darkness is cheap, and\nScrooge liked it. But, before he shut his heavy door, he walked through\nhis rooms to see that all was right. He had just enough recollection of\nthe face to desire to do that.\n\nSitting-room, bedroom, lumber-room. All as they should be. Nobody under\nthe table, nobody under the sofa; a small fire in the grate; spoon and\nbasin ready; and the little saucepan of gruel (Scrooge had a cold in his\nhead) upon the hob. Nobody under the bed; nobody in the closet; nobody\nin his dressing-gown, which was hanging up in a suspicious attitude\nagainst the wall. Lumber-room as usual. Old fire-guard, old shoes, two\nfish baskets, washing-stand on three legs, and a poker.\n\n[Illustration: _Nobody under the bed; nobody in the closet; nobody in\nhis dressing-gown, which was hanging up in a suspicious attitude against\nthe wall_]\n\nQuite satisfied, he closed his door, and locked himself in; double\nlocked himself in, which was not his custom. Thus secured against\nsurprise, he took off his cravat; put on his dressing-gown and slippers,\nand his nightcap; and sat down before the fire to take his gruel.\n\nIt was a very low fire indeed; nothing on such a bitter night.

The City\nclocks had only just gone three, but it was quite dark already--it had\nnot been light all day--and candles were flaring in the windows of the\nneighbouring offices, like ruddy smears upon the palpable brown air. The\nfog came pouring in at every chink and keyhole, and was so dense\nwithout, that, although the court was of the narrowest, the houses\nopposite were mere phantoms.

But he couldn\'t\nreplenish it, for Scrooge kept the coal-box in his own room; and so\nsurely as the clerk came in with the shovel, the master predicted that\nit would be necessary for them to part.

If I was to\nstop half-a-crown for it, you\'d think yourself ill used, I\'ll be bound?\'\n\nThe clerk smiled faintly.\n\n\'And yet,\' said Scrooge, \'you don\'t think _me_ ill used when I pay a\nday\'s wages for no work.\'\n\n[Illustration: _Bob Cratchit went down a slide on Cornhill, at the end\nof a lane of boys, twenty times, in honour of its being Christmas\nEve_]\n\nThe clerk observed that it was only once a year.\n\n\'A poor excuse for picking a man\'s pocket every twenty-fifth of\nDecember!\' said Scrooge, buttoning his greatcoat to the chin. \'But I\nsuppose you must have the whole day. Be here all the earlier next\nmorning.\'\n\nThe clerk promised that he would; and Scrooge walked out with a growl.\nThe office was closed in a twinkling, and the clerk, with the long ends\nof his white comforter dangling below his waist (for he boasted no\ngreatcoat), went down a slide on Cornhill, at the end of a lane of boys,\ntwenty times, in honour of its being Christmas Eve, and then ran home to\nCamden Town as hard as he could pelt, to play at blind man\'s-buff.\n\nScrooge took his melancholy dinner in his usual melancholy tavern; and\nhaving read all the newspapers, and beguiled the rest of the evening\nwith his banker\'s book, went home to bed. He lived in chambers which had\nonce belonged to his deceased partner. They were a gloomy suite of\nrooms, in a lowering pile of building up a yard, where it had so little\nbusiness to be, that one could scarcely help fancying it must have run\nthere when it was a young house, playing at hide-and-seek with other\nhouses, and have forgotten the way out again. It was old enough now, and\ndreary enough; for nobody lived in it but Scrooge, the other rooms\nbeing all let out as offices. The yard was so dark that even Scrooge,\nwho knew its every stone, was fain to grope with his hands. The fog and\nfrost so hung about the black old gateway of the house, that it seemed\nas if the Genius of the Weather sat in mournful meditation on the\nthreshold.\n\nNow, it is a fact that there was nothing at all particular about the\nknocker on the door, except that it was very large. It is also a fact\nthat Scrooge had seen it, night and morning, during his whole residence\nin that place; also that Scrooge had as little of what is called fancy\nabout him as any man in the City of London, even including--which is a\nbold word--the corporation, aldermen, and livery. Let it also be borne\nin mind that Scrooge had not bestowed one thought on Marley since his\nlast mention of his seven-years\'-dead partner that afternoon. And then\nlet any man explain to me, if he can, how it happened that Scrooge,\nhaving his key in the lock of the door, saw in the knocker, without its\nundergoing any intermediate process of change--not a knocker, but\nMarley\'s face\n######################\nOutput:\n\n: Here is the output for the given text:\n\n("entity"<|>"Scrooge"<|>"person"<|>"Scrooge is a character who is portrayed as miserly and grumpy, with a focus on his business and a lack of festive spirit.")##\n("entity"<|>"St. Dunstan"<|>"person"<|>"St. Dunstan is a historical figure mentioned as a saint who might have used weather to combat evil.")##\n("entity"<|>"Bob Cratchit"<|>"person"<|>"Bob Cratchit is a character who is Scrooge\'s employee and is shown to be cheerful and festive, despite his poverty.")##\n("entity"<|>"Camden Town"<|>"location"<|>"Camden Town is a location where Bob Cratchit lives and plays with his friends on Christmas Eve.")##\n("entity"<|>"Christmas Eve"<|>"event"<|>"Christmas Eve is a significant event in the story, marked by festive activities and celebrations.")##\n("entity"<|>"Marley\'s face"<|>"concept"<|>"Marley\'s face is a symbol of the past and the connection between Scrooge and his deceased partner.")##\n("relationship"<|>"Scrooge"<|>"Marley\'s face"<|>"Scrooge sees Marley\'s face in the knocker, which serves as a reminder of his deceased partner and the importance of remembering the past."<|>"remembrance, connection to the past"<|>8)##\n("relationship"<|>"Scrooge"<|>"Bob Cratchit"<|>"Scrooge is the employer of Bob Cratchit, who is shown to be cheerful and festive, despite his poverty."<|>"employment, contrast"<|>6)##\n("relationship"<|>"Scrooge"<|>"Christmas Eve"<|>"Scrooge is portrayed as being grumpy and unfestive on Christmas Eve, contrasting with the cheerful atmosphere of the event."<|>"contrast, festive spirit"<|>7)##\n("content_keywords"<|>"Christmas, festive spirit, remembrance, connection to the past")<|COMPLETE|>\n\nNote that the output may vary depending on the specific implementation of the algorithm and the interpretation of the text.\n: MANY entities were missed in the last extraction.
