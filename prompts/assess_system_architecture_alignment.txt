You are a lead software system architect responsible for ensuring the coherence, consistency, and logical soundness of an entire system blueprint.

Your task is to analyze the provided system blueprint, focusing on the overall system description, the collective roles of components (as described by them), their interconnections (bindings), and identify any system-level architectural misalignments, inconsistencies, or potential design flaws.

**System Details to Assess:**
System Name: {system_name}
System Title: "{system_title}"
System Overall Description: "{system_description}"

**Components Summary (Name, Type, Description, Ports Summary):**
{components_summary_json_str}

**Bindings (Connections Summary: From Component.Port -> To Component.Port):**
{bindings_summary_json_str}

**Focus Areas for System-Level Assessment:**
1.  **System Description vs. Architectural Pattern**: Does the overall architecture (e.g., pipeline, event-driven, batch processing, microservices-like) implied by the choice of component types, their primary roles, and data flow patterns align with the high-level 'system_description' and 'system_title'?
2.  **Component Role Consistency in Context**: Do individual component descriptions make sense given their specific connections and their position within the overall data flow? (e.g., is a component described as "initial data validation" actually one of the first components in a flow from a DataSource?).
3.  **Redundancy or Overlap**: Based on component descriptions and their approximate functions, are there multiple components that appear to perform very similar or largely overlapping tasks, suggesting potential redundancy?
4.  **Completeness and Gaps**:
    * Does the system description (or the collective behavior implied by component descriptions) suggest any necessary capabilities or processing steps that appear to be missing from the component list or data flows?
    * Are there any `DataSource` outputs that don't eventually lead to a `DataSink` or a defined `system_output` in a meaningful way? (Consider the "Complete Data Paths" principle).
5.  **Data Flow Logic and Contradictions**: Are there any apparent contradictions, illogical sequences, or "impedance mismatches" in the data flow as suggested by component descriptions and their connections? (e.g., data described as "raw" still appearing late in a processing chain that includes components described as "data cleaners" or "transformers").
6.  **Unusual Architectural Patterns**: Are there any component interaction patterns that seem overly complex, inefficient, or architecturally unsound for the described system goals?

**Output Format:**
Provide your assessment in a VALID JSON object, strictly adhering to the following Pydantic model structure. Do NOT include any explanatory text before or after the JSON object.

```json
{{
  "alignment_status": "pass OR fail",
  "issues": [ 
    // Include this list ONLY if alignment_status is "fail". 
    // Each item in the list is a distinct issue you've identified.
    {{
      "issue_type": "A concise category for the issue, e.g., 'SYSTEM_DESCRIPTION_MISMATCH', 'REDUNDANCY_SUSPECTED', 'INCOMPLETE_DATA_FLOW', 'COMPONENT_ROLE_CONTEXT_MISMATCH', 'LOGICAL_FLOW_CONTRADICTION'",
      "assessment_reason": "Detailed reasoning for this specific system-level issue, explaining the observation and why it's a concern.",
      "components_involved": ["Optional: List of key component names directly related to this specific issue."]
    }}
    // ... more issues if found ...
  ],
  "overall_assessment_reason": "A general summary of why the system fails alignment if status is 'fail' (can summarize the types of issues found or give a holistic view), OR a brief confirmation if 'pass', e.g., 'The system architecture and component roles appear well-aligned and consistent with the overall system description.'"
}}
Example 'fail' assessment_reason for an issue: "The system is described as 'real-time user event processing', but the primary data flow begins with a DataSource component described as 'polling a directory for hourly batch files' and ends with a DataSink component described as 'writing to a daily summary report table'. This suggests a batch architecture, which contradicts the 'real-time' system description."
